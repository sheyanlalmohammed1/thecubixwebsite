                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>We all heard about it. The infamous ship stuck in the Suez Canal for multiple days has garnered attention worldwide for its drastic closing of the Canal and the large disruption it caused in worldwide shipping. All of that is over now thanks to the work of officials and workers who worked tirelessly over the last couple days in order to free the ship and reopen the Canal. There is no need to review how the ship got stuck or what it was carrying or the effect that it had on the Canal as there have been countless news articles and videos made about the topic by the time you’re reading this.</p>
                <img>
                <p>What most of these articles and videos don’t tell is the story for the future because of this incident. The mere blocking of a trade route is just the start of the world’s economic problems and interests which will be defied and affected in the wake of such an event. Though it may seem like the ship alone could not have long or even mid-term standing effects on the world economy, that assertion is completely incorrect.</p>
                <p>There have been a number of effects from the stuck ship in the Suez Canal on global trade, development, pricing of consumer products, shortages, and the questions it raises about Globalization and its effects. These topics each cover a designated economic principle for the common citizen and therefore, though it may not have had a direct impact on people, the indirect impacts were unforeseeable, similar to the situation.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>The Effect on Global Trade</h2>
                <img>
                <p>It is widely obvious that a ship stuck in the middle of one of the world’s biggest cargo shipping lanes is going to cause some disruption to the global movement of goods. To begin with, let’s talk about what the shipping container ship being lodged in the canal meant for other manufacturers, countries, and carrying boats in terms of ways to continue their journey.</p>
                <p>Because the ship left no passageway for any medium or large sized cargo ships to pass through the canal, there was really only two options that other ships were forced to take in order to continue the global trade networks that relied on the canal. The first option was to wait in line. Simply put, the ships started to create a long line of millions of goods just waiting to be let through the Suez Canal once the ship was broken free from its position. This seems to have worked out well for most who chose this decision as now that the Canal has reopened, ships have begun to be sent through and the trade lines are all reopened. Though on the other hand, there were those companies and countries that chose to take option 2. In this option, the large ships were sent around the Cape of Good Hope which as a result now has added a week to shipping times and further prolonged the time that necessity products will reach shores to drop prices of imported goods and once again meet consumer demand.</p>
                <p>Though overall the actual effect on trade is not as drastic as one can think with one week being insignificant in the long term. The shortage of many goods such as oil, has led to continuous increases in prices which, with delays, could continue to spiral upward until the Suez Canal comes back to running at full capacity.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>The Effect on Pricing of Consumer Goods</h2>
                <p>Unsurprisingly to those that understand the basic laws of supply and demand, the prices of many commonly imported goods in Western countries saw massive leaps in the last week. The law of supply and demand simply states that the more supply of a good there is with equal demand will lead to a price drop, but if there is more demand than supply available, prices will increase to cover the difference.</p>
                <p>Let’s talk about the most obvious one first: Oil. Interestingly, nearly 1.74 million barrels of the World’s oil supply moves daily through the Suez Canal, so what happens when there is a complete stop to that movement? Well, people don’t just stop using oil or filling up gas. The result is that demand remains the same as supply drops and that results in a price increase. Every day prices would continue to go upward as supply levels continued to move downward. Oil prices reached 100% higher in some regions where consumption of oil is high, mainly large cities in western Europe where the commodity is especially important.</p>
                <p>Another big effect was on business supplies. Unsurprisingly, many companies had large quantities of shipments needing to come in on time for consumers, but with over 800 boats waiting on both sides of the Canal to pass through, the business cost is increased. Furthermore, many of the shipping companies were forced to charge up to 2.3 million dollars extra because of the stuck ship as it added a multitude of expenses to let the large ships sit and wait for their turn. The result was a lose-lose situation in which shipping companies and companies based in regions such as the UK were both incurring losses due to the situation.</p>
                <p>Two other big products from the region include iron ore and apparel which both have seen increases in shipping times worldwide with major retailers and wholesalers incurring 20% losses because of negative sentiment to their imported goods. The iron ore industry also ran into problems with construction as materials are constantly needed to continue to build more infrastructure which delays many important schedules across Europe, but many contractors have already begun planning how to get back on track after the freeing of the Canal.</p>
                <p>Overall, there are a lot of products stuck in the process and many businesses are questioning their movement methods using the seas, and why wouldn’t you be. With the shipping crisis costing the global economy nearly $400 million an hour and over $9 billion a day, it is no surprise that there is widespread redefining to the way that people want access to their products in the case of a crisis. This brings us to our next process with how redefining future situations is a result of globalization.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>The New Questions about How Globalization could Effect the Economy</h2>
                <p>Globalization in general is seen as positive for the economy and worldwide development. The general belief amongst economists is that expansion of more countries and companies to new shores generally brings about advancements in innovation and connection and forces competition on domestic and international levels. Though the Suez Canal crisis of the last week has shown a big downside of global reliance on external resources for many countries. The reliance on the raw materials, products, and parts manufactured by countries to the East of Africa was definitely shown, especially on materials such as oil from the middle East and finished products from Western Asia. Does this mean controlling 12% of the World’s trade could become a problem in the future? Well, yes.</p>
                <p>What exactly does this event actually signify about the world economy due to this globalization though and increased reliance? The chart below shows a graphic from the Financial Times which shows a common pattern in the last decade. As shown by the graphic, the number of actual ships that go through the Suez Canal on a daily basis has stayed nearly the same in the last decade. The biggest difference is the size of the ships as the ones in the more recent years toward the end of the decade have begun to carry cargo that is a lot heavier and more cargo in general.</p>
                <img>
                <p>The clear link to this information is obviously the fact that increased globalization in the last decade, especially in Southern Asia, the Middle East, and Northern Africa has led to a net increase in the number of goods that are exported from the region. The Suez Canal, at the time it was built, could never have estimated so much globalization of trade networks to occur, and the current trend within the increase weight and amount of goods and number of ships passing through the Canal presents an interesting question. What can we do to make sure another stuck ship doesn’t basically shut down the ability for transportation of goods across seas for these regions?</p>
                <p>The quick answer is that, well why would this ever happen again? The point is that there is no doubt that with more emerging economies in the region will result in bigger or more ships with more goods leaving the shores and passing through the Suez Canal. Expansion of the famous canal or a movement for alternate method for the shipment of goods may be necessary to meet future demand needs that the countries within the region provide worldwide.</p>
                <p>The simple answer is to create a bigger fleet of aviation based trade within the central portion of the region in the case of an excess of goods, but that simply would be unsustainable and a lot more costly. I believe the answer lies in the expansion of industry within the regions which rely on the goods in order to maintain economic growth but not outpace the creation of infrastructure in the process until solutions and expansion of current trading infrastructure within the Middle East, Northern Africa, and Western Asia can be created.</p>
