                </div>
                <br>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The solution to solving wealth inequality has taken off in the last part of the series. This is the next follow up to the original part of the broad solution which is tasked with laying out a series of steps that have to be elaborated on in order to create a timeline and step sheet that the government and businesses  could follow. The original part of the broad solution was tasked with describing setting up an organizational aspect of the solution as to how to receive extra funding and how it would be used for promotion of small businesses which would in turn increase middle class wealth. This part of the solution talks less about organization and more about the initiatives that both businesses and policy makers will have to partake in for the solution to be a complete success.</p>
                <p>An important thing to remember for this part of this  solution is that not all the steps that will be mentioned are necessary. There are some that will be necessary to keep stability and continuity throughout the process, but some are replaceable with similar initiatives or can be removed altogether. This is simply my personal recommendation based on statistical and logical evidence on the best way to go about investing and taking part in new processes by the government and businesses in order to maximize the amount of economic output from that organization. This following section is not in order of policy, so if you would like to read about a specific type of policy, please just go ahead and go to that section. This is a free roam style writing. The hope is to build a more complex framework of financials linked to government policy that would prevent future drawbacks of the policy and lack of competition. Before we begin, I would like to thank everyone reading this for the supported  parts 1 and 2 to the economic inequality series. It provides a lot of motivation knowing that there is a significant number of people looking at my policy and idea proposition about a real problem. Let’s get started with talking about everyone’s favorite economic policy: taxes.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>The Plan</h2>
                <p>Well I think I have addressed taxes for a large portion of the series because they are such a significant reason that we can point to the fact that the government’s wealth accumulation does not reflect the same proportion of wealth from individuals. What this refers to is the fact that let’s say that someone with a net income of $100,000 pays $10,000 in taxes. The proportion of their annual wealth to the government is 10%. Then on the other hand, there is an individual with an income of $20,000,000 yearly, yet they pay only $200,000 in taxes which comes out to be simply 1% of their annual income contributed to the government. Though the individual with a greater income is paying a greater portion of money to the government, it is still nowhere near as much as the individual with a smaller yearly income. This thought has already been discussed. That just clears why the following solution to taxes would be implemented.</p>
                <p>This initial tax policy that is to be addressed is not aimed toward collecting taxes but rather tax breaks. Specifically, they will be used to open up opportunities to small businesses to take advantage of an even greater number of tax breaks, allowing for a wider range of financial freedom with a significant increase in capital access. The way in which it will work is to actually aim towards increased employment by small businesses. This specific policy proposition is as follows. The federal government will have to release a new tax amendment that allows for a code which opens up 20% of a business or corporate taxes to be used in the form of wages for non-employed employees in the upcoming tax year. This means that when a business that employs under a 100 employees submits their tax forms, they will have to agree to the new hiring conditions that are specified under the form and specify a list of new hires or hire that will allow for a tax return to be claimed that will return 20%  of their taxes back to them. Most would be concerned that this would create a lack of government balanced budget because of the sheer number of tax returns that would be claimed. This is largely incorrect because of other areas in which the government can obtain parts of the income back (For example: from the employee’s income tax). This policy would also be open to the owners of the business on their specific tax forms as well. They too would have to individually agree to contribute to a new hire wage with their tax returns and would be subject to investigation and incarceration if they were to disobey the law and use the money for personal wealth. Another important characteristic of the returns is that they could not be used to pay anyone of direct relation to the owner. To minimize the number of false payments that would go to a direct member of the owner’s family, therefore disregarding the point of the return altogether, they would be automatically disqualified if they listed a family member of direct relation as the employee for hire for that tax year. The whole point would be to force the owners to look outside their comfort zones for new employees which would increase the new hires as a whole that cross class distinctions for successful businesses. Some more of these conditions will come later. Another possibility would be that the owner has the option of withholding on hiring more employees if they agree to use only 10% of their return on current employee benefits. This can range from financial help, insurance, investment help, therapy, or any other access that employees would benefit from. The Result would be an increased quality of life for small business workers, putting them in the same category for pull factors to large corporations. Overall, access to this capital would decrease unemployment and increase benefits for employees. </p>
                <p>This next part of the solution is absolutely necessary in order to actually change the wealth landscape. There would have to be a quarterly check on the consumer price index to make sure that inflation has not taken hold from the increased amount of aggregate value going into the economy. A small spike in inflation is expected but over the course of the first two years, the hope is that inflation minimizes from its original spike after release. What we are really worried about is extreme inflation taking hold and setting us back farther than we were originally when we started the process of implementation. This would be catastrophic and will be discussed more in depth in a section of the series that addresses the biggest drawbacks of acceptance of these policies. The main point here is to create a committee that is charged with the calculation of change on the consumer price index that is attributed to the specific policies mentioned within this proposition. The number should theoretically stay as close to zero as possible and absolutely not go into negative territory, but that is basically impossible unless an outside factor such as a crisis emerges. The reality is that the number will be less than 0.5% added onto natural inflation on the positive end of the index. This committee will be charged with finding both the annual, bi-annual, and quarterly increase in inflation. They will also be tasked with finding out if this inflation is limited to the industries targeted within the small businesses loans sector or if other industries have been affected. If other industries have been affected, they would also look into why they have been affected and whether or not that is beneficial to the competitive stance, wage, and economic output of the business. This is simply for research purposes. It is optional for the government to create this committee, but it would be a great way to be preemptive of a possible market crash caused due to raging increases in inflation and be able to point out where increased inflation was coming from. It would make it much much easier for economists to create counter active deflationary policies aimed at the specific original policies that caused the inflation in the first place. Furthermore, a lack of inflation increase is only probable due to money supply. This is supported by the equation of exchange since we are by no means increasing the money supply but simply removing investment money from large corporations and individuals to be used in another area. With no change in MVM, money velocity, or the money supply, the theory states that there should be no increase in inflation itself. This though isn’t completely the story as you have to take into account the money velocity and supply within a single industry. This is a possible downside but will be discussed more in specific economic downsides in a future part of the series.</p>
                <p>The next thing we need to discuss is business development. We talked about how in order to create an accurate understanding of the strategies are promoting small business employment growth, revenue increases, and build up of relevant assets, it would be important to look at a business financial ability and growth while it was under the process of expanding/expediting its operations with the help of extra capital. Now, to check up on the small term growth of the business, a financial department at the SBA could be created that would handle the information regarding tracking business growth in multiple sectors. This would include gathering tax information from small businesses that agree to have their information closely monitored and tracked by the department. Furthermore, the SBA could provide financial analytical consultancy to the businesses that voluntarily chose to participate within the study of their economics. This would also stray businesses away from using unethical money practices in order to save money in the form of taxes or other government payments which would likely increase government tax revenue yearly as the majority of it comes from small businesses. The type 2 psychological maneuver can be used to support the fact that businesses will always move to support the government if it supports them. It is a natural business economic reaction to repay a part of their success to those that contributed to it. This is similar to the reason that small business employees get constant wage increases based on correlation to substantial increases in business profitability. Simply, if a business makes more money, they will pay employees more who were part of creating that excess amount of money. With this evidence linked to business habits, it is probable for an increase in tax revenue to occur through an increase in government support for the majority of taxpayers. Many would make the argument that the government would be running a deficit, but it would be quite the opposite in most cases. Furthermore, with the data gathered on business development, standards for business development could be set within two years of policy initiation. An effective development could lead to an official standard to be set for financials and from there, businesses would be able to follow a better step process to successful asset growth. After this occurs, continuing this practice of consultancy can become optional.</p>
                <p>Now creating business development is of no use if it is not going back towards those who are making the business successful: the employees. In this case, paired with the same department focused on business development, there should be a test of working conditions development for the employees. Now this takes a poll of everything from a safe working environment, to physical conditions, face interviews if needed, and surprise inspections to maintain conditions that receive a score similar or higher than the year before. The scoring would be similar to the health and safety department, but instead, with only an emphasis on the A better quality of life is directly linked to better and happier working conditions, so taking into account factors that create those working conditions can meet the ultimate goal of crossing class distinctions with balance of work and life on a better wage. Speaking of a better wage, small businesses do already submit paperwork on their payrolls and it would be beneficial to them for the government to see that an employee who has worked there for over 18 months is getting a wage increase every six months based on performance of business.  There is not a required percentage increase, but the goal is to promote and habitualize increases in wages which causes increases in government taxes, but also provides an increased net income for the person receiving the wage. An opposite but important payroll law put into place instead of incarceration for not meeting the required guidelines could include taking away benefits of the 20% loan write off from the excess tax fund for use in business development with justification in court as linking to internal development of the business.</p>
                <p>Another controversial way of expanding low income wealth development is implementing an expanded earned income tax. There are multiple ways that this development would help grow personal wealth for those that need it the most, which are the lower income class families and individuals as well as middle class families and individuals. An expanded earned income tax would boost tax credit for childless workers, providing those with no children the ability to claim more than the mere $500 credit they can earn. This would allow many to take on financial stability based on guaranteed return and claim while providing others (those with children but divorced), the ability to gain a lot of support money for their children or personal lives. I would recommend at least tripling the credit available to these people, about a $1000 increase on an annual basis which would result in income support to low wage workers. It would improve their liability and loan payoff rate while also providing excess money needed for personal growth items that can be put out of reach through inflationary pricing during times of need. This would generally bring the income of childless families closer to that of those with children, bringing better stability. With this we could see an increase in the number of people who are confident to start families leading to passion for job sufficiency. In the end, not only would this provide a better quality of life, they would also receive financial stability on some payments that put families into outstanding debt. For families with children, expanding the earned income tax could look at a 0.5x increase that would most likely cover some educational spending that families can sometimes not afford. This specific policy would also open up the credit to more age groups, including those from 19-25 years old and seniors over the age of 65.  This would only be the case depending on the income bracket within which they fall and tax write offs that they have already occurred. Again, providing more financial leniency to more people is a great first step expanding the financial growth of an entire class.</p>
                <p>Alright here’s another way that a lot of families specifically could expand their wealth concentration with some government help. In order to engage more workers  at their jobs, it is likely that the businesses would need an active workforce of employees that are willing to commit to the job which they are receiving or working on. The most effective way to do this in my opinion would be through taking out external factors that may affect a large amount of the workforce which is caring for small children. The way in which I would recommend to do this is to subsidize child care facilities that specialize in small youth care for children that are two young to stay home alone. By doing this, parents would be more inclined, especially mothers, to drop their children to a child care facility during the daytime and take part in contributing to the workforce. Not only would this be able to expand the workforce demographic in terms of family participation, it would also change the demographic of gender participation because of the fact that a greater number of mothers, females, would be joining the workforce. A step toward a more equal workforce demographic on gender could end up leading the way for a charge in terms of economic output, therefore justifying the movement for equal pay among the genders more than ever before. The result would be better work family lives with a greater sustainable income by both members of the couple, more access to resources for the children in the future to break class barriers, and better mental and physical health with a greater amount of expendable income that could be used to increase the quality of life. This is not to mention that taking part in this act would primarily affect middle class citizens where there is the greatest amount of maternal leave from the workforce based on child care. This part of the legislation is based entirely on theoretical and logical thinking based on economic productivity, but if it were true, it would justify the subsidies for child care.</p>
                <p>The next part of the plan includes changing the form of living experience that the majority of the middle class and lower class enjoy with the introduction of new infrastructure and initiatives within the classes which builds upon common bases which are covered by the government, but in a way that seems not to be enough to satisfy the needs of the majority of the population located within the class distinct communities. These infrastructure plans not only will include common things such as improved safety restrictions and education funding as well as a focus on practical education, it will focus on housing communities and how to increase the overall quality of life while the wealth accumulation of the classes changes in relation to the upper class.  Better living circumstances is correlated to increased career motivation which means a larger percent of satisfied workers with their career options and an increase in entrepreneurship as well.</p>
                <p>Now that we have talked about career motivation, how do we deal with expansion of youth mindsets and education standpoints within middle class business endeavors. In this case, the solution I was able to come up with was the use of student loans in a case of a write off  of a percentage of income if employed by a small business. In this case, we stick with a small business as defined by a company with 200 or fewer employees. There would be no minimum number of employees which means that self-employment would be included in qualifying persons for the incentive regarding education. What this means is that students with qualifying college loans from public universities in the United States would be able to write off all loan payments as an expense when they filed their taxes up to 20% of all taxes paid could be devoted to loans, essentially taking up all loans that the average person would pay on their student loans anyways. This means that new students and young professionals would be largely motivated to stay within the boundaries of middle class businesses and give large amounts of dedication and time while it happened because of the fact that they can take on more risk when they are young. They would gain lots of learning and practical experience in a field that would contribute to the success of the business while receiving pay increases and paying off their student loans. It will initially be difficult for businesses to offer the same salary that a fortune 500 company could along with the same benefits and use of time, but practically the smaller company will provide more personal attention to the employee and with the benefit of paying off student loans, there will be some experience in terms of equalization of opportunity. It will no doubt be a couple years until we see a practical hold of the practice take place. </p>
                <p>Lastly for the broad solution, we have an implementation of policy based on expanding middle class infrastructure and opportunity to help with career achievement usually only available to the upper class due to limited education and extracurricular opportunities. The best forms of infrastructure to drastically change the way of the future wealth concentration in the United States. This is based on the theory of class change which states that to change class means to change the way of life of the person, but the majority of those changes can only come in a case of increased education to students of the two lower classes and access to opportunities not commonly available to the students. This could be access to organizations that arrange travel plans for students or even the creation of sports teams for uncommon sports such as rowing or jousting which can be awarded scholarships to large schools. In this way, expanding in expanded practical experience outside the classroom will be extremely helpful for students to get into prestigious universities from which opportunities will be widely available.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>That will conclude the majority of the broad solution for equalizing opportunities to solve wealth inequality. The next part of the series is based on a concept that we have yet to delve into details with: Investment. With changes in the circulation of profits in the economy, there will be a change in where the most profitable investments will be and how they can be accessed by the general public for passive income growth. We will review these concepts in the next part of the series. After which, there will be the beginning of specific policy implementation that will be discussed and the major drawbacks of the solution will be included in there as well. Stay tuned for these upcoming articles!</p>
