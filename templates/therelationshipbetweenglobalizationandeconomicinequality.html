                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The world is moving extremely quickly. Faster than ever before. The result has been that in the last decade, there has been an increase in globalization through many platforms. Economic globalization, political globalization, and cultural globalization have changed the way the international community interacts with one another. Generally, economists tend to believe that globalization is for the betterment of societies worldwide as it supposedly increases the quality of life of everyone by creating specializations for effective production. While this may make globalization seem like a no-brainer for the majority of countries getting involved within a growing international network, there is a needed evaluation of domestic and international interests in order to derive whether globalization is truly beneficial to all citizens in all countries that choose to participate.</p>
                <p>The concept of globalization is a lot more complex than simply the expansion of international networks. Over the past month, I have delved deeply into the concept of globalization. Specifically, in the following article, I will reference studies done by the Peterson Institute, the Urban Institute, the United Nations, and a slew of private research universities which not only show the importance of three distinct factors in the creation of globalization but their role in the creation of domestic economic inequality. While this is primarily important to the quality of life and inequality paradox that exists within developed economies, the topic of interest is actually the creation and reasoning behind the existence of the following paradox.</p>
                <p>As mentioned before, there are three specific reasons I found that can be attributed to the rise of globalization in the last two decades. These are the development of technology, expansion of public and private infrastructure, and rapid urbanization to create metropolitan regions. This is of course in regards to economic globalization. These factors do not consider the added complexity of political fractionations, region’s self-interests, unaffected immigration patterns, conflict expansion, or other forms of globalization that have had less physical effects through an economic landscape. As a result, the conclusions brought up within this article may only be generally applied to economic globalization rather than globalization as a whole, but for the sake of conciseness, I will simply refer to this concept as globalization.</p>
                <p>More importantly to the concepts of this article is the inverse relationship between globalization and domestic economic inequality due to the same causes listed for economic globalization. While it may seem that in this case, the widely accepted promotion of cross-border movement of information and goods is misplaced through governments. There is also an inverse relationship between domestic inequality and quality of life in many developed countries. It is unsurprising to me, therefore, that when facing the problem of inequality and globalization, policymakers have come to no conclusion as to what to do.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>The Effect of Modern Technology on Economic Globalization</h2>
                <p>In recent years, the expansion of technological networks has been indescribable. An economist in Japan working on behavior theory under strained product market conditions can send his work to a British psychologist studying the irrational and excessive spending done by low-income households in times of slow job market growth. According to a study done by Stanford University, the world exchanges 2.5 quintillion bytes of data each day and a little over 33 zettabytes of data each year. The flow of information in the free world has broken any represented boundaries and for this reason, it is the one portion of economic globalization that cannot and may not be slowed down. While the free flow of information has been one of the most progressive portions of modern society, it is actually an indirect effect of this technology that has presented a danger to domestic economic inequality.</p>
                <p>For this portion of the predicament, we will generalize the effect of modern technology to those living in highly developed regions with the semi-major use or development of technology. This includes innovation hubs, manufacturing hubs, and service-based economies. This is still a notable amount of the population as nearly 62% of the world’s population lives within these portions of the economy. Furthermore, the World Bank states that nearly 70% of the world’s GDP goes through digitization. We rely more and more on technology as this number is nearly double what it was 20 years ago.</p>
                <p>As mentioned, the development of technology and economic inequality can show an inverse relationship compared to globalization and the primary reason for this is the creation of skill-based bias and technological job market changes within a medium-term length. With the central development or reliance on technology by an economy comes a need to educate a workforce. As a result, differences in quality of education and field of expertise with specialization in regards to technology have created distinct differences in the relative skill levels of workers coming from low-class and middle-class backgrounds.</p>
                <p>Through my research with “Intergenerational Income Mobility Affecting Wealth Inequality”, I established the positive correlation between education level and social mobility. Basically, those with better levels of education are more likely to change their social class within society during their lifetime. But why is this specifically the case with technology especially? Well, it’s called the technological advancement gap. In short summary, the creation of advanced technology opens up a service sector that relies on technological skills. As a result, workers who have desirable skills move up rapidly along the income chain while those without the needed skills or adequate education experience little income mobility. This is important because the biased changes in income level create notable income gaps between middle-class and low-class communities. In 2020, the average salary of a tech worker in the United States, one of the most technologically reliant countries, was around 120,000 while the average income in the country is 56,000. While initially, technology itself is not to blame for the changes, there is an exponential spread and hold of technology-based industries on the current economy. To illustrate this, take the U.S. fin-tech market. This market is estimated to grow by nearly 11% in the next decade along and double its reach within the next quarter-century.</p>
                <p>While we have established the income gap between technology industries, there is the question of within the sector itself. I mentioned that with “desirable skills”, comes a greater emphasis placed on a worker. As a result, the tech industry is not exactly equal in itself. For example, a software engineer in a hospital in Houston, Texas makes around $110,000 a year, while someone of similar credentials working within AI development can make up to $500,000 a year. Yet another person of similar credentials working within local government systems makes an average of around $65,000. While we saw that large gaps exist between the average income of relative industries surrounding tech, the gap within the industry itself is growing as well.</p>
                <p>The danger comes in the presentation of long-term consequences for the job market. Not only do certain tech fields get a larger representation of the population due to the income disparity, but they receive rapid growth in their respective fields. Think about the last decade. We have seen the greatest revolution in AI, gaming technology, and web development. These industries still show to be the greatest to grow in the upcoming future, and as a result, it makes sense that income disparity will continue to increase.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Expansion of Public and Private Infrastructure Increases Domestic Inequality?</h2>
                <p>Public and Private interests fuel economic development. In this case, global economic development. When it comes to public infrastructure expansion, the reasoning behind it comes down to government interests. Most governments want to increase their total output or GDP in the long run. As a result, when it comes down to making strategic decisions for placements of pivotal infrastructure, they choose to contribute to the development of many already developed areas of their nations. As for private interests, they are generally concerned with making a profit or extending their profit margins. There is also the factor of corporate environments and most generally profitable populations. This leads to certain factors that drive private interests to certain portions of infrastructure while overlooking others.</p>
                <p>The ending result of both this public and private infrastructure is the expansion of globalization. While public infrastructure does primarily target domestic development, it also directly appeals to foreign investment and foreign product availability with the creation of markets through centralized infrastructure networks. When it comes to private infrastructure development, we look at expansion across borders. Generally, it is private companies that will be the ones coming from across borders to create new offices, manufacturing plants, mining operations, service platforms, or other common investment operations within a certain country. The result of all these interactions that come with the expansion is a more connected world. Japanese oil companies can now mine for rare minerals in South Africa only to sell these valuable materials in European markets. Chinese technology companies can introduce software platforms in the United States and still use Chinese servers for the majority of their processing power. American financial service companies can establish offshore interests in the Caribbean, European subcontinent, and South East Asia. The limits are endless for the economic interests of the rest of the world to get involved with an emerging economy.</p>
                <p>But how does this contribute to inequality? At first, I was not exactly confident it did. When looking at the World Inequality report from 2020, I stumbled upon infrastructure as a key component of inequality. Within the report, it stated a research study done by two scientists on the Indo-Pak border. After looking through the research on a separate platform, It seemed that the scientists only looked at a single incident and attempted to generalize it. Instead, I focused on some research of my own. Specifically, I looked at the development of essential and non-essential infrastructure within Lagos, Nigeria. This city in Nigeria has a population of around 15 million which gives an adequate amount to study over its landscape, but more importantly, its population is set to nearly double to 25 million within the next decade which means it still has to satisfy a large infrastructure requirement. Here is what I learned about this cities infrastructure:</p>
                <p>The first thing I noticed with this city was its road network. What I found was the unique disparity between its road reliance and road spread. Basically, around 95% of its goods and services rely heavily on the road network, but only around 70% of the roads are easily accessible by all members of the city. While the inner portion of the city has easy access to the roads, the outer portions of the cities are left with very little access to the roads. As a result, there has been a problem with heavy traffic in and out of the city which reduces the opportunity cost of outer members of the city to get involved in the extensive economic network within the city. What I found even more surprising is that because of traffic jams, the government continued to expend resources on current roads rather than expanding their network. Of course, the road extension theory states that simply increasing the size of the road won’t help with the majority of traffic and of course, it hasn’t, yet their road network has grown very little within the last five years. It is quite a paradox. At first, I was quite confused as to what was happening until I looked into the actual makeup of the city.</p>
                <p>One important thing to consider was the public-private infrastructure makeup of the country of Nigeria. In this case, the country has a private contribution to GDP of about 92% and 8% of its GDP comes from its public contributions. As a result, the country’s government has heavily relied on private interests for infrastructure development over the last two decades. The government simply cannot expand on its infrastructure plans due to budget allocations. This is quite concerning of course because it leaves the fate of 40% of the country that lives below the poverty line in the hands of private interests. It is also notable to note most of these private sector interests are foreign in nature as the city is quickly developing the makings of a future service-sector hotspot.</p>
                <p>To no surprise, most of these people have been largely failed. There are usually two courses of action that come as a result of private interest in an economy. These are the pushing of money where it already is or using lower-income people for the hard labor in manufacturing industries. Sadly for the lower-class population of Lagos, Nigeria, they have had to experience both. Because the main concentration of Nigerian-based and foreign-based corporations is within the center of the city, the infrastructure paths are based around that point. As you move away from the city, the infrastructure gets progressively worse. Unlike other developed cities within the Western Hemisphere, this developing city does not have the concept of suburb development. What we usually see in cities, especially in the United States, is that as you move to suburban settings infrastructure increases. There is easy access to roads, hospitals, government offices, and other essential infrastructure. In Lagos, there is something very similar to European development of cities which indicates extremely well-made infrastructure in the middle of the city that gets less developed as you move outwards. As a city created from British control in the early 20th century, this makes a lot of sense. The downside to this is that, unlike British expansion policies, there is a heavy reliance on private infrastructure. Specifically, about 80% of foreign private investment has come into the city of Lagos. The quality work environment is centered around the middle of the city where the majority of private infrastructure lies. This is where the upper-class citizens stay. While the outskirts of the city suffer from the masses, the inner city continues to flourish, creating the inequality that we see commonly.</p>
                <p>Unlike many developed countries, the government of Nigeria recognizes the need for expanded infrastructure in the lower-class portions of society. As a result, there has been a slew of projects being brought to the region to uplift the economic wellbeing of these communities. The most important of these is called Infra-Co, which is backed by a $3.6 billion infrastructure expansion project targeting the expansion of essential transportation and power networks for those citizens living below the poverty line and forced into low-skilled manufacturing work. </p>
                <p>While studying Lagos, I made comparisons to the research study found in the United Nations Inequality Report on the Indo-Pak border. I found that similar to the private infrastructure interests within Nigeria, the governments of these two regions focused their public infrastructure on the expansion of their urban areas near the cities. As a result, the poverty-stricken villages that surrounded the small cities got little increases in quality of life and became exponentially less wealthy compared to their peers in the city. On the other hand, the trade involvement of the region grew. Not only did the foreign service sector rise, but the public service sector gave strong support to government manufacturing industries which in turn increased the net exports of the region. In the end, I found that both public and private infrastructure, without actually targeting lower-class interests, will create better industries that can work across borders but will also inherently focus on the development of regions that are already flourishing due to the opportunity cost of developing underserved communities without guarantee of profit.</p>

                <h2>Spatial Inequality: Urban Development Promotes Economic Growth and Economic Inequality</h2>
                <p>Spatial inequality is exactly what it sounds like. It is inequality caused by physical space between two things. In this case, we are concerned with domestic inequality so when referring to the term spatial inequality, it is in reference to two things within a single country. There are actually two spaces that are of interest to this study. There is the relationship between different rural and urban regions of a country and the relationship between different areas of a single urbanized city or region.</p>
                <p>To establish the relationship between urbanization and its effect on both global and domestic economic output, some key statistics need to be taken into consideration. First of all, the majority of economic output across 135 countries in 2021 was through urban regions, whether that be through manufacturing industries or service industries. Furthermore, after looking at each of these countries, there was not a single instance where the appearance of an urban region was present and there was less total economic production within a country compared to its rural regions. If that is not convincing enough to the point that there is a clear relationship between urbanization and economic output, here is incontrovertible proof: After narrowing down countries that saw a greater than 20% increase in population urbanization over the last two decades also saw a greater proportion of foreign investment within specific urban regions and within subsequent years, a steady incline of foreign imports along with global exports. As a result, although correlations do not necessarily indicate causation, it can be safe to assume there is a positive economic output relationship with urbanization and global involvement.</p>
                <p>To begin with, let’s consider the Gini coefficient. It is an index measurement that measures the level of income inequality in an economy. A Gini coefficient number ranges from 0-100. A 0 indicates a perfectly equal economy while a 100 indicates a perfectly unequal economy. It is basically impossible to see both of these numbers as they would indicate economic scenarios where labor motivation would not exist. For an example of how this number is applied, let’s say the U.S. has a Gini Coefficient of 50.0, this indicates that the top 1% of earners in the U.S. make about 50 times the bottom 90%. When taken into context, the real numbers of the Gini coefficient can truly show the danger of an increasingly unequal society. Some example numbers are that South Africa has a 63.0., Brazil has a coefficient of 53.4, and Zambia has 57.1. The point is that the Gini coefficient can give a real idea of the extent of the economic inequality in a select country. Surprisingly, in the context of the 21st century, the Gini coefficient shows the world is getting more equal. While through the 19th and 20th centuries, this coefficient was on an incline, it has declined in recent years. As a result, it can be falsely be assumed that economic inequality is no longer as large of a problem as it was in the past.</p>
                <p>What most fail to overlook is that increasing average wages come from the increase in service-based jobs provided by urban middle-class and upper-class regions. The wages for these jobs have nearly doubled in recent years due to a steady increase in demand. With a higher average education level across the global board, workers are more likely to have the skills needed for these jobs which spread the wealth concentration over a greater number of people. On the other hand, as we noticed, within populations, the job demand is not the same, and inherently low-income jobs grow much slower than the upper-level service sector or private sector jobs mentioned earlier. As a result, there is also a change within the urban landscape that affects these jobs. Shifts in demand move the focus on higher-skill jobs with urban planning getting thrown out. This can be seen within Lagos, Nigeria again which shows the concentration of the higher-skilled jobs near the coast of the city while the lower-paying jobs move out toward the edges of the city. As a result, it was also indicated that the majority of urban tools, such as access to greater technology, were seen within the coastal regions of the city. As a result, it can be assumed that within cities, inequality can be expanded due to urban tools.</p>
                <p>While talking about domestic inequality, there is also the key factor of urban against rural regions. In this case, urban regions have a lot more resources for globalization. As a result, economic output is a lot higher for these regions than for rural regions. This is nearly always the case once an urban region comes to light in a certain portion of the country. When thinking about it in this way, the opportunity cost of rural residents moving to urban regions only goes up when they do not move. Yet, behavioral economics can explain that moving factors and fear of failure can account for irrational reasoning that is made reasonable for these residents. As a result, they generally fall into greater poverty and are unable to afford the cost of moving without total resource consumption which then becomes a psychology system. Again, a contribution of fear of losing everything for nothing seems irrational when in reality there is almost a four times higher chance of them becoming financially stable in an urban region than staying where they are. This sort of decision is common among low developing countries that have not seen rapid urbanization. They tend to have less spatial inequality as a result, but they have less technological development, infrastructure, education systems, and stable living conditions. It really is a trade-off that creates the enticing viewpoint of ignorance towards economic inequality.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>The first thing to remember when studying economic trends is that correlation between two events does not necessarily mean they cause each other. In this case, we cannot make the conclusion that globalization leads to economic inequality. Instead, we can confidently say that with rising globalization trends around the globe, we have also seen spikes in income inequality in select regions. While the paradox of the quality of life and economic inequality is clearly bought to light, it cannot be safe to assume that it merely exists due to natural factors. There must be effective planning in order to avoid it. This can come in the form of changes in institutions, development patterns, changing investment routines, and moving foreign investment to underdeveloped regions of the country, especially the low-income regions of urban areas. As a result, there may be a chance to counteract the effects of the actions seen within the information above and establish a more equal world with less elitism-based areas.</p>
