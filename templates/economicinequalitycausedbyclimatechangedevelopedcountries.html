                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Climate change is widely regarded as one of the most pressing issues on the planet. Unsurprisingly, there have been mounds and mounds of legislation passed trying to combat this looming problem. Also unsurprisingly, climate change has only increased within the last decade and though countries have promised to reduce emissions to near zero within the next two decades, many scientists think, and rightfully so, that there is a very unlikely chance that this happens with increasing globalization. This globalization has been impacted by climate change in hundreds of ways, but today I want to talk about how its relations to climate change has created and continues to contribute to economic inequality on a global scale.</p>
                <p>Usually, my articles are specific to economic inequality in the United States, but this time, I would like to create an image on a worldwide scale because economic inequality is not solely limited to U.S. borders. With emissions only on the rise, economic inequality continues to be created. In the following article, I want to talk about how carbon emissions can create indirect inequality and what can be done to combat these underlying effects beyond just reducing carbon emissions worldwide.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Background Information</h2>
                <p>First, let’s dive into some background info on climate change and carbon emissions from an economic perspective. It is a general misconception that the reason that climate change is such a problem is that economists argue that it is needed in order to support the economy and millions could go into debt if it stopped. This is somewhat incorrect. While it is true that climate change has economic motives for the occurrence with increasing carbon emissions coming from manufacturing economies, this is not the whole story. The truth is that the increased carbon emissions for many of these economies put their entire economic infrastructure at long-term risk just as much as they support them in the short term. According to New York Time’s writer Christopher Flavelle, it is actually many of these manufacturing economies that are at the most risk of economic collapse in the long run if they don’t cut down emissions. Specifically, he states that Asian economies could see a one-third reduction in their output due to related reasons of climate change. Some of the most important reasons include crop failures, rising sea levels reducing port city access, and widespread disease linked to rising temperatures.</p>
                <p>This is simply not the most important effect that he characterizes. He goes on to state that according to international reports compiled by theoretical economists worldwide, wealthier nations would be on average 10% better off in the long run if climate change was not a factor in their production habits. Not only would wealthy countries be affected, but so would poorer countries, and most of them in even worse ways after the risk of climate change permanent effects are played into their development indexes.</p>
                <p>This is only the start of the problems that come with increased carbon emissions in the long run. Many short-term factors are not played in that do directly affect labor performance, wealth accumulation, market stability, supply and demand outputs, and more. It is not lightly stated by many of the world’s most renowned research scientists that climate change could end our stable and dependent lifestyles as we know it to a point beyond return. Now that we have established the severity of the consequences, let’s dive into how cross-region economic inequality comes as a direct result of climate change.</p>
                <p>To do this, I want to first address how wealthy economies, namely Western economies and large manufacturing economies, would be affected by increasing carbon emissions in both the long run and short run. In the short run, the effect is a lot more controlled since many have made the economic tradeoff needed to support current lifestyles or quality of life with the use of fossil fuels or carbon emissions.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Short-Term Effects</h2>
                <p>Some of the most notable effects in the short run include decreased health quality in manufacturing regions, the decreased incentive for renewable energy alternative research, and the creation of further reliance on dangerous energy sources for economic output. Each of these is extremely important when talking about the effect on more developed countries when it comes to climate change. First, let’s talk about the general decrease in health quality and why this is important to the economy. When it comes to health quality, this is in reference to the general health of an individual which has in recent years actually decreased in many developing manufacturing countries. Though this problem will be discussed more in developing nations, it is still notable in many developed ones. In this case, I want to take the example of one of the easiest to spot areas where there has been an effect on productivity in the short run due to air quality caused by carbon emissions which is in China. China is considered a developed primarily manufacturing economy that has in recent years had one of the worst air qualities among developed countries. Unsurprisingly, China’s workforce has been put in harm’s way and it is common for inefficient workweeks to happen due to the further decreasing air quality in select regions in the country. Not only has this affected the manufacturing sector of the country, but the developing services sector of the Chinese economy relies on the human overlook of its immense financial network and technology interfaces. The compromised workforce health caused by an increase in emissions can reduce the efficiency of workers anywhere from 15%-50% depending on the air quality index that day and as a result, it decreases the efficiency of economic output from the country as a whole.</p>
                <p>Another effect in the short term on Western countries would be decreased research incentives for renewable energy solutions in the short term due to the lower prices of carbon-related fuels which decrease economic reliance on sustainable energy sources. What this directly indicates is that because fuel prices continue to drop due to the increased economic activity of major oil suppliers in the Middle East, Northern Asia, and North America, there is the likelihood that this promotes the use of an opportunity cost that involves the further mining of oil instead of moving resources to research incentives looking for its alternatives. The reason that this happens is that lower fuel prices mean that major oil suppliers have a lack of adequate income on their barrels of oil. This leaves them with the option to take a smaller payday or increase their mining efforts in order to make up with the quantity. This creates a money paradox. The more they mine, the greater the supply of oil in the world economy which drops its price even further. This provides further incentive in terms of opportunity costs for developed nations to spend their resources on oil rather than renewable energy sources since they are immediately receiving more for their money in the short run which is why it becomes an opportunity cost problem.</p>
                <p>The last negative effect in the short term is the increased reliance on further detrimental energy sources. Like I mentioned previously, this just digs the economy into a deeper hole which just makes it harder to get out of and eventually just leads to it is deeper and deeper. The alternate reasoning behind this does not just come from resource distribution but from supply chains. Our supply chains are heavily dependent on oil for modes of transportation. Everything from trains, ships, and trucks uses gas in order to move the majority of the products which are contributing to globalization. There is a danger that lies in the ability of this supply chain to continue to occur if we were to completely cut the natural gas supply in the short term. If this were to happen, as it has in the past during the oil spike earlier this year due to the Suez Canal crisis, there is a drastic increase in the general price level. Earlier this year, in March, this led to an increase in the general short-term price level of 10%-15%. It was catastrophic on a global scale as the oil supply shortage started to shut down certain trade routes that required large amounts of oil. Our globalized trade networks crumbled due to a simple crisis having to do with a single source of our energy supply. This is the drastic nature of the problem. Without an easy-to-access energy source that does not rely on a supply chain for its manufacturing, there is little to no chance that the general western economy stays afloat in a time of crisis which is cause for concern. Furthermore, there are some areas of usage of our natural resource supply that are completely dependent on our current energy supply without a renewable resource alternative. The one that immediately comes to mind is the aviation industry. There is absolutely no alternative to using oil or jet fuel to move long distances in short amounts of time which begs the question on what would happen if there were to be a supply chain problem in the short run with these resources or they stopped being provided altogether. We would have no way of efficiently exchanging ideas or information on a global scale through in-person interaction and the globalized information exchange network would likely come down in pieces.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Long-Term Effects</h2>
                <p>Although there are likely so many more areas of improvement when it comes to carbon emissions and overall climate change in the short run on these developed nations, these are some of the most notable macro-effects when it comes to the current incline of our carbon emissions till the year 2030. These thoughts do not indicate the dire nature of the circumstances in the long run for developed nations specifically in regards to economic changes as a result of climate change. The most notable of these effects include permanent workforce reduction, limited resource and supply management, decreased total economic output, increased infrastructure costs, and increased costs of societal maintenance coupled with decreasing productivity.</p>
                <p>First, the most notable direct effect of climate change is a permanent reduction in the service and manufacturing industries’ workforces. This permanent reduction comes as a direct result of the decreasing health quality caused by decreasing air quality mentioned during the short-term section. The long-term result though is a lot more serious in its effects. This comes in the form of economic productivity. A decrease from full employment would theoretically be coupled with a decrease in real output in an economy. Furthermore, workforce reduction means that increases in technological fields slow down and therefore, the entirety of economic and social progress can be affected. Let’s say for example that the health of full-time workers was compromised by the time they reached 60 years old and that became the new accepted time of retirement due to declining health conditions. The result would be that the opportunity cost would be equal to the total possible output by that singular worker for the time that they would not be working which in today’s conditions they would. Now, this amasses to around nearly $50,000 of contribution per worker. And according to the Brookings Education Insititute, this number would amass to around $23,000,000,000,000 in decreased amount by the year 2050. Now just to put that into perspective that number is equal to the GDP of the entirety of Africa in 2019 times 12. Also, to make it worse. That number is only the yearly cost of the loss of the workforce which means in a decade we will be missing out on enough money to completely develop every developed nation on the planet, provide every individual with access to healthcare and education, and solve world poverty. Then do it again about 5 times over. Again, I cannot stress just how much the effects of the workforce will truly impact the economy. I mentioned that there would be an effect on social and economic progress beyond imagine. Well, innovation is directly linked to the number of people involved in its application. According to an econometric analysis of the National Development Index, a correlation value of around .932123 indicates that the relationship between the two outstanding variables is profound. What it truly means is that without the application of the hundreds and thousands of minds, who are lost in health conditions linked to rising temperatures, in continuing progress for developed countries, it is likely that we will see a drop off in the rate of development for technology and its surrounding systems. This is a tough pill to swallow when you consider that the major motivation of 21st-century research is aimed at technological innovation that makes our lives easier. Approximately, 86% to be exact.</p>
                <p>Sadly, this still is not the end of the effects of a permanent reduction in the workforce. When we consider economic inequality, we consider the fact that workers have to not only maintain a high income and constant investment habits to equalize the power and social landscape, but they must maintain this with longevity. I hypothesize that a permanent reduction of the workforce, specifically in service-related industries of developed economies, will cause an increase in the Gini Coefficient across the board, wiping out nearly half a century of work in balancing economic opportunity. This is in part to the fact that the majority of the top 1% of income earners gain their income through passive ownership while the bottom 50% earn their income by working constantly. This means that even if the top 1% were equally affected in their health conditions to rising temperatures, which is unlikely in itself due to better access to healthcare, they would still have a constant income source to grow their wealth while the bottom 50% would need to rely on government support which would likely only cover living expenses. Therefore, the wealth gap would be further increased beyond its already detrimental rate of increase and threaten social progress all around the world. Not only would this prove to be terrible to long-term economic progress after the fact, but it would decrease work quality and general worker happiness which are factors when it comes to labor motivation which again plays role in decreasing economic productivity.</p>
                <p>The next, and possibly worse, the effect of long-term climate change on developed economies is resources production and availability on a global scale. Though developed countries do not account for the majority of resource production, they do account for the majority of their consumption. A fact that is very unlikely to change even as they promise to cut down on wasteful resource usage without meaningful policy to back it up. There are many pathways of mutual destruction that can lead from this resource consumption in the long run. To begin with is just that there is a cut down in resource production altogether. As the amount of resource consumption increases, there will likely be a decrease in aggregate supply produced as input factors have large price gains that push up supplier models and push down target profit margins. What this means is those small resource suppliers will be forced to produce less with the same input factors for a higher price. From here their profit margins continue to fall if consumption stays stable from higher class communities. Soon, rapid inflation will take over due to stagflation caused by a lack of supply in the economy. Major luxury good markets could collapse or become out of reach to the common middle-class household due to its inflationary prices. This is when a price paradox will ensue in developed countries. If a government were to use monetary policy to drop inflation by increasing interest rates, it would drop demand for resources but permanently settle a new higher price level. This would only be semi-permanent though as naturally, the supply will continue to fall as consumption increases due to population increase and demand rises after which monetary policy will only be so useful until it is caught in a liquidity trap of sorts. More specifically, money velocity will likely increase rapidly due to limited supply as it does during lockdown crises. This will only further push up the price level since the output is not changing over that current time period. The production possibilities curve for this level of output would show it moving inward, basically, the pricing paradox makes prices go up which steadily decreases supply in the future in the short run at a constant pace so that there is no stability in the supply market and the resource consumption gets more expensive. As a result, there is the less total supply of finished goods in the economy, an unstabilized market for goods, and monetary fluctuations when it comes to the relationship between supply and demand.</p>
                <p>The next part of the effects of supply comes in the form of global political fractionation when it comes to supply shortages. The reality is that the global network has never been fair in the way it distributes goods. There is a clear inequality that exists between the supply and population relationships. To give a simple example, Brazil does not have a developed market for luxury goods like Mexico, yet the two have very similar populations and developments. It is just the fact that Mexico holds a greater economic and military power in the world economy which gives it further access to a luxury market for goods (being neighbors with the most powerful country in the world does not hurt either). This is just one of many examples of inherent inequality when it comes to equal quality of life in different countries. In the long run, when less supply is available, due to decreased production of crops and other resources, this inequality will cause political conflict among countries. There will be a race to gather resources for supplies. Namely from undeveloped countries which have yet to tap into their resource production models mentioned in the U.N. development charter. When military conflict happens, it will use laborers that could be contributing to meaningful economic development which will cause further instability in employment and in organized service industries that would be struggling due to lack of long-term educated workers.</p>
                <p>The last notable long-term effect of climate change on industrialized or developed nations is the increased cost of maintaining and expanding infrastructure. Inherently, it is no surprise that without any change to climate change pace in the upcoming years, there will be a labor shortage for essential personnel and likely a number of constant supply shocks that threaten political intervention. It is true that these create instability in how society will operate under a new economic infrastructure, but it is also true that this infrastructure will only last so long. The whole point of our current globalized market is that it opens up economic opportunities. Therefore, producing what is needed is now not a choice but a necessity in the case that a stable supply chain no longer exists. It is truly a paradoxical feat that would exist in the extremist of cases. Yet the more direct and notable infrastructure that would be hit is one of the coastal cities. More than 80% of coastal cities that contribute more than 75% of the economic activity in a region direct the majority of their activity within a 10-20 minute drive of some access to water, air, train, or mode of transportation that the entire region depends on. This is not just in the U.S. but worldwide. Climate change threatens rising sea levels and many people here that “the cities will drown”, but it is not that they will drown that is the problem. It is the fact that the economic activity they create will drown with them. If the sea level were to rise as high as the U.N. Board for Climate Change presented in 2017, it will prove to be lethal to maintain the infrastructure that sits near a large body of water. The biggest epicenters for economic activity in the world, including New York, London, Paris, and Hong Kong, will all face a bill of billions of dollars to only maintain their infrastructure already in place. Not to mention that with expanding populations comes the need for expanding infrastructure. I suspect that with maintaining the high-profile economic regions that surround their coast, they will forget notable initiatives that they have passed to help lower-class citizens get above the poverty line. This is the one area in which I am not relying on facts but theoretical models. Classical economics relies on rational expectations from citizens and governments. The truth is that cutting other forms of funding will be difficult, but the rational alternative would be to redirect funding in coastal cities to keep the economy afloat. There really are no good options, but the opportunity cost of letting the epicenter for economic and financial stability for a given country sink is too high to ignore for any economist. It is not something that can be prevented through taking policy action either. A physical problem will come when the cost of maintaining infrastructure increases. This is similar to what can be currently be seen in high-income cities such as San Francisco, California and Seattle, Washington.</p>
                <p>This will slowly be indirectly contributing to economic inequality. By maintaining activity that the corporate world relies on, small business growth will suffer. An increase in infrastructure and city expansion has a direct correlation to small business growth, at least in the United States. I hypothesize that if expansion initiatives were given less funding or if the funding was entirely relocated, it would negatively impact small business progress and economic diversity in a given area. If it happens, it will prove catastrophic to the years of building small business initiatives and investing in low-income community infrastructure.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Everything above is only half the story. The beginning of a long line of problems that will come as a result of climate change only starts now. The second half of the story is about what happens to nations that are still developing or living in conditions of poverty. In the next part of this series, I am going to break down what are the effects on those living in such countries. Furthermore, we will discuss what specifically should all these countries do in order to negate the negative economic effects of climate change, specifically in terms of the danger it presents to economic equality and policies in place. Stay tuned!</p>
