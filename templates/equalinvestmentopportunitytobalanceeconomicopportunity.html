                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The opportunity of investment is the last portion of the broad solution that is left to be described and discussed. This is easily the greatest portion of restructuring needed in order to deal with unproportionate amounts of investment opportunity and detail. The truth is that there exists an easier and more efficient investment process for those with a greater expendable income, meaning that a proportionate relation exists between the total investment done by an individual annually when compared to their annual income. This problem not only logically exists, but statistically, it is easy to break down the fact that there is a gap in which breaking out of average middle class living conditions, allows for greater financial security with the increase in investment that occurs. This is aggregate or total investment, which takes into account investment within education, stocks, real estate, expenditures, start ups, and anything else that involves a risk taken investment by an individual. The gap exists when needs have been met and savings no longer seem to be a viable option for the individual in a time of economic opportunity.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>Through a econometric data analysis of 5,000 individuals with an income range from $10,000 to $3,000,000 annually, I was able to conclude that the gap exists when breaking out into a 3 figure salary and again after $250,000. The way in which I was able to do this was to take a data set of a sample of 10,000 people and conduct a simple regression model relating income and amount invested on an annual basis. According to a high r-squared value, also known as the variance caused by dependence between the variables, the amount of income, the independent factor, can explain the change in the amount invested over a period of time. This, though, is not a linear model in which case the correlation between the two factors cannot be related through a linear slope value with the income of the individual with a constant within the equation. A non-linear model means that at certain points, income points in this case, there is a greater amount of change than at other income points. For example, changing from a $50,000 income to $100,000 income may have a lower change in investment than from a $200,000 to a $250,000 income. The level of investment that is of interest here is the percentage of income invested into growing assets. This is the number that gives high income levels a greater amount of security in financial growth. What I mean by this is the difference in percent invested by higher income amounts is much different than that of the lower income class. For example, someone earning $70,000 a year could be investing $3,000 annually whereas someone earning $1,000,000 dollars a year could be investing $150,000 annually. Now looking at this in terms of percentage of income invested, we can see that the first individual is investing around 4.29% of their income while the second individual is investing 15% of their income. Now let’s discuss why this is statistically significant compared to that of the original. If we look at these forecasts, we see that $3,oo0 compared to $150,000 is a 50x difference in amount invested while the change between $70,000 and $1,000,000 is around 14x. Statistically speaking, these two do not compare hand to hand. A point of comparison between the amount invested shows a much greater change when compared to income and creates a biased picture toward value sets. On the other hand, the percentage change only shows a 3x difference invested which doesn’t seem that absurd for a 14x income differential. That is until you consider that the percent invested also accounts for a greater aggregate amount invested. Basically, as common sense dictates, a higher income means that 1% of the income is larger than the smaller income and so the percent invested shows a much larger overall investment even though the percentage may show a smaller change.</p>
                <p>In short words, people who make more money, invest more of their income in both percentage of the income and total amount.</p>
                <p> Why is this important? Well for one thing, it shows that investment opportunity is skewed in a direction to the left which makes the right side a better investment group portion that is related to income class. It also shows that overall the amount invested is much larger and of a greater proportion for those with a greater income. The last thing that this directly shows, and most importantly,  is an uneven balance that would allow for a greater amount of growth than the lower class in terms of investment returns.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For the unequal  investment returns, let’s continue with the example that was shown to demonstrate the importance of percentage of income invested. Here’s where it can get somewhat complicated to control the growth of wealth when it comes to the elite, and why it is logical that the rich grow richer while the poor grow poorer. Let me direct your attention to the table I have created below. One column shows the growth of the money for the individual that invested 3,000 while the second shows the growth of investment for the individual that invested $150,o00. This table insinuates the growth of their investment if it were to be solely placed within the S&P 500 ETF, SPY, that has an average return of 6% for the last two decades.</p>
                <img>
                <p>This table shows a couple of aspects. One and most notably is the growth of wealth at an exponential rate that occurs due to investment. The second, and more important aspect, is that there is a greater divide that occurs between the total wealth accumulation from investment for the two individuals. We initially stated that there was a 50X difference between the two when they began to invest. After a decade, that difference actually stayed the same at a 50X difference. Wow the wealth gap went down didn’t it! Not at all actually. Sure the difference remained the same since they were identically put through compound increases, but the initial difference in wealth of $147,000 actually increased to $470,448.991. More than 3 times the difference in actual amount. This insinuates a higher wealth gap created after 20 years than that existed originally. This isn’t the whole story though.</p>
                <p>Next, let’s take into account the fact that I said that there is an additional investment that is put in every year of the same amount from each individual. This means that individual 1 will contribute $3000 every year while individual 2 will contribute $150,000 every year. This will continue on for as long as they are within the investment community. It is likely that this is a more realistic scenario as investments compound over time with extra contributions from the individual. Let us look at the change in the value and difference between the two accounts over the same periods of time that we looked at in the example above. </p>
                <img>
                <p>This shows a significant amount of more realistic and accurate information related to constant investment over time. Looking at the numbers, there are a couple of key differences we see this time. One is the substantial increase in the final amounts of the two individuals’ investments which of course makes sense considering that the initial investment was set to a contribution on an annual basis. The second is the difference between the two investments which was originally 50X, then 50X, and now it is 50X. Lastly, there is the difference in value which originally was $147,000. It changed to $470,448.991 in the last trial, and now it has become $5,878,930.82. I hope by now the increased difference in amount while constant change in difference of value has come to light.</p>
                <p>The rich are indeed getting richer, but they are doing so at a rate which is constant to that of the lower class in this demonstration. This, though, does not tell the entire story.  I mentioned that I ran an econometric modeling simulation of around 5,000 individuals and their investments. Well, I also looked at the most probable form of investment and overall probability of diversity of a portfolio beyond three or more distinct investment types. Again, I found that there was a linear correlation to that of income and investment portfolio diversity. This is presented in the form of a low probability value of occurrence, explaining that this is not shown by chance. This probability value was lower than 0.025 for, indicating a 99% confidence in the fact that the linear correlation did not occur by chance. In this case, it signals a distinct difference that exists between income classes and investment amounts and diversity. This presents the primary problem that investment reform and education in the solution is aimed to solve.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p>Within the solution, we will not be targeting the amounts of growth that the investments occur. We saw that the difference between the initial and final amounts stayed the same due to percentage increases remaining the same, so the best way to break out of the constant increase in the long run is by increasing the return percentage. This, in theory, should decrease the wealth gap while increasing portfolio value and diversity with good investing habits. It should be clear that this will not balance the amounts between two individuals of very different investing habits, but it will allow those with less income to make better investing decisions to gain an edge on financial advice that the elite have access to. </p>
                <p>The first and most notable difference should come in the form of financial education and personal financial literacy. The simplistic model of personal financial literacy is sometimes not known to average citizens who do not leave much or sometimes any money left for investing while keeping a notable portion in a savings account. They also have options through a 401k if they are not in a dire circumstance with a need for an emergency fund to be available and liquefiable at any time. This also brings about the opportunity of education on a secondary standpoint through loan access with an increased credit score. The goal of education on financial options to a majority of the population about specific circumstances keeps people from taking on financial burdens that they may not be able to handle. Furthermore, opening up routes to financial freedom comes with an increased financial organization. Because the two ideas go hand in hand, focusing on financial organization may also open routes to financial freedom. Overall, the access to personal financial literacy may increase the number of people who truly know their financial capabilities, especially young adults entering the workforce with no prior financial management. </p>
                <p>How exactly would we deal with the spread of further personal financial literacy? Well, this comes down to the communities which are being targeted by different initiatives. For example, for middle class communities, we may show investment options paired with smart loan payments and restructuring to decrease the debt that the middle class is in to elite/government owned banks while increasing assets. We would also likely show the difference between passive and active income and how that may relate to the investment options they have in terms of liquidity needed that suits their lifestyles. If we were to target low income interests, we would focus on high liquidity portfolios and getting the funds to put into investments rather than the concept of investing itself. Explaining a step by step process would be beneficial to those who would need to take the consultation into long term consideration. Creating a timeline that spread over the course of 6 months would likely be the most useful to these communities. This though isn’t the only logistical difficulty with implementation. We also have to take into account reaching a minimum of 10% of each community which sounds a lot easier than it really is. 10% may be only a portion of the population, but it is a sizable amount of working class people. With minimal time on these citizens’ hands, we have to show results from our methods of teaching in order to appeal to this larger audience.</p>
                <p>This is where the research initiative of the portion comes into play. While practically the methods we show may work, will these methods be accessible to communities in different regions in the United States and across income classes? That is the golden question. Without real practical application, we may now be able to justify implementing the financial literacy portion of the solution for investment. The research initiative would be grouped as follows. Using a simple random sample, we would take 200 members from two different communities in 6 different regions of the United States. The two communities would be a lower income community and a middle class community/suburban region that lies within a major city in the given region. The regions of interest here are the West Coast, the South, the Midwest, the Northeast, the Southeast, and the South West. This brings the total members that take part in the study to about 2400. These participants would be randomly sampled from an age group of 25-45 year olds and be selective regardless of gender. They would be required to not have a spouse which could be changing the single contribution, and they must not be dependent on any other individual for financial help. We would observe over the course of the year if the implementation of financial literacy would help them better take a course of action to reach greater financial organization. This is a subjective point of view, which could be biased. This is why we would use quantifiable measures to show greater investment and financial health. These measures for instance would likely be a portion of income directed towards investments on a monthly basis and annual basis, credit score, asset growth on monthly and yearly basis, net change in liabilities on a monthly and yearly basis, outstanding loans amount, and net change in net worth on a yearly basis. There are many other possible tracks of looking at financial standpoint of the person such as rating the liquidity of their investment portfolio through a scale that takes into account major investment types.</p>
                <p>Following the completion of a year of research, we would collect the past 5 years of financial information, including but not limited to credit reports, loan reports, tax returns and filing, investment taxes, portfolio values, individual investment values, and other financial documents such as personal spending on categories of items. Using this data, we could do some econometric analysis on the data. Using the data provided for the five years in the past, we could derive a pattern of growth that occurs on average across an entire population group for a region. Using this data, we could consider a statistically significant change within the markets that would occur. Considering no change to the rate of growth of the financial health of the population as the null hypothesis, we would test to see if there was a significant difference in the growth of financials for the individuals from the specific group and region, considering 12 different scenarios in this case.  With low probability levels of occurance on a 97% confidence interval, we would be able to establish a statistically significant change within the data set. If this were to show up in any of the 12 populations we tested, we could justify implementation of the program within those communities to a program committee.</p>
                <p>This, though, does not completely summarize the solution as we still want to open up access to new opportunities for lower class and middle class citizens to take part in their investment habits. The way in which I believe this can be done is through the creation of a whole new category of investment based on the current markets. This may be a little on the extreme end of the spectrum of creating change, but I want to focus on higher risk investments that could break the steady return rate that many of the elite tend to stick to. By creating greater returns, we would be cutting down the difference between final values even if the elite continued to contribute more, leading to a more efficient investment process for the lower and middle class. Efficiency is the key in this situation because by creating better investments than basic returns, we could increase the amount of returns that the average middle class has come to expect. Through this, a new standard is created where middle class returns are increased exponentially as time goes on through compounding amounts in investments over the long term. </p>
                <p>This though, is risky, as higher risk investments insinuates a higher risk of failure and loss of the entirety of the investment. To the wealthy, this may not be a problem as they already have access to an amount of support if they were to reach failure, but convincing those in pressing debt to take on a high risk investment is difficult without some sort of trust in the process of success. This requires not only trust in the investment process, but a higher understanding of it. This part of the solution theoretically works if the people were to take on this specific form of investment in the correct process and order. Simply committing halfway would not guarantee success. Let me explain.</p>
                <p>This portion of the solution involves further investment in middle class small businesses that have a net worth of over $4,000,000. How exactly do we limit risk when committing to investment in small businesses and how would an organization work in this process? Well, we are committing to the future, and for that reason we will be creating an investment portfolio that includes these businesses for those that directly are affected by them: the middle class and lower class owners.</p>
                <p>To begin with this solution we have to talk about the organization of these investments. We want direct effects to be done to similar middle class people, keeping profit within a closed organization. This is a completely optional investment program for small businesses that is similar to that of large businesses in modeling at least. There are quite a couple of ideas this entails. First of all, the idea of shared ownership without shared decision making will be implemented. The original owner or owners of the small business may ask for an investment from their peers for a startup or idea, but they still own all ability to make company decisions. The investment will see returns on its own and rather than creating a board of middle class citizens making small decisions for a small business, they would trust the company that they had originally invested in. This keeps growth continuous and runs the situation similar to that of an actual market exchange. The main difference here is that we want both the investors and the company to profit, so the owners will have the ability to buy out the portion of their company from the investors after a year of time has gone by. If the value of the company has increased, they will have to pay them the amount of which it has increased as a return for their investment in the percentage owned amount on top of their original investment. </p>
                <p>One other really big idea is limiting how much an investor can take ownership of a single company in participation. We want investments to be small but useful, and because we have established that middle class investment is not of high amounts, investment will be limited to 5% for up to 50% investor ownership. What this will theoretically do is push middle class investors into a diversity of portfolios with more than one major investment. This should somewhat limit the risk that the investor is taking on by committing to a small business. Furthermore, this will align with middle class investing interests which are not nearly as heavy as the elite investment numbers that are reported in the media. Through a more controlled setting of investment, there is the large opportunity of growth, especially for startups that can take on that role of a need-fulfilling business for competition with large firms in middle class communities. </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Overall these changes to investment will affect not only those who directly invest or take the investment. Overall, it will affect everyone who has anything to do in the investment market whether that be in business investment, private investment, charity investment, or any other form of investment that it could take on. By theory, this should increase the access rate of the middle class to match or be higher than that of the upper class in the long term. Therefore, it would be effective in combating long term wealth inequality.</p>
