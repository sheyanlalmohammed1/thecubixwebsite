                <br>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Wealth Inequality is defined as the uneven distribution of wealth across a population of people. In this case, that population of people will be the United States population. Wealth inequality comes as a part of economic inequality in which classes are created in order to categorize the growing diversion in the quality of life and standards of living. It exists severely here in the United States and it’s quite easily able to be shown in terms of practical use.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Background Information</h2>
                <p>This is where the wealth spectrum comes into play. The wealth spectrum is the range for which wealth ranges within the population of the United States. This spectrum is a defined field where the net worth of all individuals in the country is held on a straight line. What you will notice is that the graph is nowhere near symmetrical but rather skewed to the left as the majority of people sit on the left side of the spectrum. Although sitting on the left doesn’t seem horrible when being compared to everyone else, the spectrum has shown to have the majority of Americans within the first branch of total wealth level. For emphasis, more than 50% of the working population, who works their entire lives to gather wealth, will most likely never get out of the first bracket of wealth. As you move to  the  other side of the spectrum, it is easy to notice where the difference comes into play. This side is home to the billionaires. Those who have wealth equal to that of a king. Well, in reality, they are worth quite a bit more than most of the living royalty across the globe. This is the extreme side of the wealthy. The biggest and most successful that have ever existed in history. The truth is that their wealth is beyond comprehension. The pure net worth that they have is larger than any amount that the majority will ever see. The value is a number so long that text boxes have to be expanded to just be able to read them. In this case, the number we will be focused on is a net-worth of $1,000,000,000 to $200,000,000,000. In the essay, the wealthy are those whose net worth can be found within this range of values. Let’s put the minimum amount of wealth into perspective.</p>
                <p>The unthinkable sum that is 1 billion dollars  is what gets you the tag of wealthy, but what exactly can be done with this tag? Well, you could buy 1,000 million dollar homes. You could buy at least a couple professional sport teams. You could buy every work done by Da Vinci himself. You could buy 10 yachts. You could buy more than 15 private islands. You could roam the world for the rest of your life. You could buy a couple commercial planes, far more expensive than a regular private jet (it would be cheap in your taste). Of course those are just upper class things you could buy. Let’s think more in terms of everyday items. You could buy anything imaginable. That pretty much sums it up. You can buy anything you would ever dream of and more. However, this doesn’t really show how much of a difference the wealthy have from the lower and middle class populations. Well let’s say an individual works for $10 an hour (greater than minimum wage in some states), they would have to work for 100,000,000 hours to achieve the same net worth and save every single penny they earned. This would mean they would work for nearly half a century without ever stopping to be able to claim the same net worth as the wealthy. To the majority, this presents a problem. Why do they have to work for so long? Why can’t they succeed so easily? Why work tirelessly for others’ benefit? The short answer, capitalism.</p>
                <p>Although the version of the free market found today in the United States is of much higher social value than that of the Laissez-Faire capitalism that began the creation of wealth inequality, there are many factors which can be developed to create a sustainably higher quality of life for all individuals within the country, regardless of class. There is an economic value of a capitalist society to breed competition in the best state. This economic characteristic is referred to as the creation of advancement in the job market and development in the corporate environment. Though these two factors are important, they don’t explain the reason that capitalist society prevails today and the reason it has created wealth inequality. The basis of capitalism is the idea that the companies with the best products and prices will succeed more prominently than their competitors. The result is that the economic value of these companies/corporations to society increases. What would we do if Walmart didn’t exist? Where else can we find everything? The multi-billion dollar corporation drives consumer sales in every category from groceries, clothing, furniture, technology, and literally anything else anyone could ever ask for. The point is that the value that the producer and retailer holds in our society now is unprecedented and competition is nearly impossible to deal with. There is no other store in the world that can give you something from every major consumer category in one place at the best prices available. It seems impossible to deal with. That is the real effect of capitalism.</p>
                <p>Well this still doesn’t explain the idea that workers can never achieve success in getting out of their wealth bracket. The real truth is that it comes down to the economic value of a person. The true meaning of this social science based theory is that people’s economic value is directly correlated to their value to society. The reason why the founder Walmart has a greater net worth than the person who works as a chef at a restaurant is easy to distinguish between. The chef is replaceable. There are plenty of other people who can cook, they may not be able to cook better, but they can get the job done. If the person who created Walmart decided to not exist, the value that the company held in society would be gone and for that reason the correlation between society and economic value exists. The rich just hold more value than any other individual person because of their inability to be replaced. The rest of us can be, and it is why we are not worth what the upper wealthy class is. That’s the truth in a capitalist society and it always has been.</p>
                <p>Let’s take a trip down memory lane, a little before all of us had memories, to the age of industrialization, development, and manufacturing when the true roots of capitalism began and wealth inequality took place in its purest form. In this time period, major corporations began to appear. Some notable examples are Standard Oil, Sears, Ford, and other major companies that still exist today. The fact that they still exist today illustrates the fact that because these companies were able to lead their industries and outdo the competition, they succeeded in longevity. The men who ran these corporations became known as robber barons and for good reason. They practically created the idea of workers being replaceable which contributed to the largely low standard of living for workers today. As the expansion of new businesses occurred in the following century, workers gained access to more luxury goods, ability to purchase personal homes, access to steady supply of food, easier transportation which allowed for new location expansion, increase in wages and specialization that allowed for a change in class standing with the use of higher education. The majority of people led better lifestyles than they had ever experienced before, and though the majority of the wealth still lay in the hands of the elite, the common man was better off than ever before.</p>
                <p>Let’s jump a hundred or so years to the current 21st century in which there has been little to no reform for the overall well being of the average citizens in the United States. Yes, there has been the introduction of new economic policies meant to target certain income and ethnicity groups that were meant to revolutionize the job market landscape, but in reality, these “revolutionizing” concepts failed due to multiple factors including controversial takes that led to major widespread disagreement on political motives in relation to party beliefs. </p>
                <p>The truth is that people haven’t changed their standard of living significantly since the end of the cold war, and it is truly sad. What we consider to be the best economic times in history are really developmental figures that compare statistics with nearly 100 years ago when sanitation was a commodity. Now, we are in the age of technology with the most rapid evolution of societal norms than ever before, and there is still an argument that we are doing enough to make the lives of the lower and middle class citizens better. The truth is we are not. Not at all. Don’t let the statistics fool you. We may have the greatest economy in the world, but the system is meant to help the big companies, not you. There is so much work that is left to be done before we can claim that we truly used the modern age to change society. </p>
                <p>There is a need for change. A need for better living standards of the underprivileged. A chance for financial stability. A chance to get access to equal opportunity. A chance to get a large part of the economy that is built on their backs. A chance to live without going from paycheck to paycheck. A chance to claim the majority of the wealth that they spend their lives working to create. A chance for success. A chance of happiness without immense struggle. A chance to live a pure life. That is what wealth inequality is all about. How can we distribute the wealth of the country in the most effective yet most fair way?</p>
                <p>This is why this problem is so pertinent, and it is the reason why you are reading this paper. It’s because you care about your future ability to live a comfortable life no matter what the economic circumstances may afford. A luxury for now that is only awarded to the top 1% of society. The problem, as depicted, has existed for a while. Years have passed without true legislative change to deal with the growing difference in quality of life of the elite and the lower class. The government has done little to nothing to solve the actual problem at its core, but let’s take a look at what exactly has been done in response to the growing divide within the wealth spectrum. This is in response to the growing power of big corporations.</p>
                <p>When given the task of solving income inequality in America two solutions are often brought up: job subsidies and tax cuts to promote job creation and taxing the rich more for increased aid towards the poor. Both of these solutions are incredibly flawed. Subsidies from state and local governments to attract employers cost as much as 80 billion dollars a year. </p>
                <p>Cities have offered Amazon billions of dollars to have Amazon’s second headquarters which would employ tens of thousands of people in their cities, These subsidies include tax forgiveness, cash grants to cover relocation expenses, and for Amazon cities even offered partially giving the state payroll tax on their workers’ salaries back to Amazon. However, there is no conclusive evidence proving that these subsidies actually create jobs instead of just inciting competition between cities to attract large corporations, effectively moving jobs around the nation instead of creating new ones. This can be seen as the Economic Policy Institute stated that the billion dollar subsidy given to Amazon for a fulfillment center did not increase private sector employment in the county it was located in. On top of these subsidies, the Trump tax cuts were centered around its ability to create jobs. Republicans cut corporate tax rate by 40% which will cost the US government over a trillion dollars over 10 years. However, this extra capital being kept by businesses has not helped with GDP growth. If job subsidies do not create jobs and corporate tax cuts do not boost the GDP, then why is the United States spending hundreds of billions of dollars on them every year? Furthermore, the jobs being created by these industries are oftentimes near minimum wage and involve horrible working conditions. Nearly half of America earns less than $18,000 per year which is barely over the single person poverty line. On top of that, people stuck in jobs where they are harassed or unsafe are stuck there as there are very few options to find work let alone work that pays a living wage and provides good working conditions. If the few jobs being created by job subsidies are incredibly low quality, then why does the United States government continue  encouraging such actions by continuously dumping money into the dumpster fire that is corporate job creation? Policy makers have to start looking for alternate conclusions.</p>
                <p>However, increasing corporate taxes to provide more aid to the poor is not the solution either. Most aid provided to the poor is through non-cash programs that are necessary for their survival. A mere 10% is given in cash. This 10% is usually used towards paying off bills and debts, not in self-investment that could lead to future financial gains. Even if increased financial aid was provided to the lower class through taxing these mega corporations, it would be near impossible to provide enough money for people in the lower class to feel comfortable enough to make substantial financial investments in something like a small business or even something smaller such as stocks or property to create alternative streams of income. As a result, funneling more money into the poor is unlikely to create economic growth for them nor the country as a whole. There is just a lack of financial stability. The government playing the role of Robin Hood sounds great in terms of political motive, but for practicality purposes, the existence of a capitalist society creates increased reliance that doesn’t change the financial makeup of lower income classes.</p>
                <p>For these reasons, instead of looking at the upper and lower class to make change we need to look somewhere else for once. The middle class is the home of America’s small businesses, but they are plagued with issues that lead to 20% failing after one year, 30% failing after two years, 50% failing after 5 years, and 70% failing after 10 years. While there are numerous problems that lead to this trend of failure the most prominent one is the lack of capital which is found in nearly a quarter of small businesses. Most small business owners know how much money it takes to operate their businesses in terms of day to day operations. However, they often overestimate the revenue that can be generated from sales leading to debts instead of profit. Additionally, in crowded industries, with increased competition, small businesses often dramatically decrease their prices to bring in customers, but when kept too low for too long, debt adds up leading to bankruptcy after which the business loses its economic value. Even when this does not lead to bankruptcy it leads to two major issues: the inability to increase/maintain wages of employees at times and the inability to grow the business. It is obvious that these small businesses are in desperate need for capital but they get little aid from the government. They get no attention compared to the billions of dollars that corporate America receives. Something has to change.</p>
                <p>The small businesses that can maintain the necessary capital to thrive provide incredible impacts on society. There is a direct correlation between access to capital and job creation in small businesses. The same cannot be said for corporate America whatsoever. If these small businesses are effectively creating jobs with their capital, then why would the government keep funneling these subsidies into these large corporations that have been ineffective historically. If the hundreds of billions dollars being pumped into the companies was redirected towards the middle class, the effects could be groundbreaking. The middle class often has very little debt, and existing debt is usually manageable. Extra financial aid would then be used to take risks that could not be taken before such as being able to confidently start a small business, knowing that capital would not be an issue. On top of that, the success rate and growth of existing small businesses would skyrocket if capital was no longer an issue. With growth comes even more jobs and often higher wages for those being hired, usually the lower class or other middle class. Policymakers need to realize that continuing to funnel capital and benefits into large businesses is the equivalent of beating a dead horse. The existing subsidies and tax cuts do not create substantial change and America is in desperate need of some. It is time to look to small businesses for once.</p>
                <p>Now that there would be a larger number of stable small businesses, the legislation that is considered to be potentially the best way to solve income inequality could finally be implemented safely, increasing the minimum wage to $15. The major issue with introducing an increased minimum wage is that it makes hiring low/unskilled workers very unattractive. It would be unaffordable for small businesses, bankrupting many of them, and it would lead to large corporations hastening the switch to automation to replace certain occupations. However, now that small businesses have more capital for increased wages along with the ability to provide more jobs in general, they would be able to support the influx of workers from corporate America looking for high wage jobs along with increasing the wages of their own workers. Now you might be wondering why small businesses would not just use automation as well but surveys have shown that only a third of small businesses plan to implement automation, admittedly a number bound to rise after the increase in wages, and even then they still a quarter still plan to hire more employees due to business growth, another number that would grow due to increased available capital. Changing the minimum wage to $15 would change the lives of millions of Americans. They would finally have a living wage. A wage that would do more than just help them scrape by but rather a wage that would allow everyone to live a comfortable life.</p>
                <p>Some might argue that the shakeup that the increase in wage creates between corporate America and small businesses in terms of employment is far too drastic, and they are objectively right. This migration of workers would be unprecedented and completely change the way Americans find jobs forever, but it was bound to happen anyways. Automation is inevitable and it will take the jobs of numerous Americans when it arrives leaving many unemployed. At least if we allow for small businesses to grow first, we can make sure that those who become unemployed will be able to find a job in a small business. It gives us the opportunity to properly prepare for a dramatic change that has the potential to devastate uncountable American lives if dealt with improperly.</p>
                <p>The average increase in wage also presents a common problem when put into relative terms with inflation, but if the overall wealth landscape were to change permanently while maintaining a wealth capacity similar to the one that exists today, there would be a chance to increase standards of living by providing low income workers with the ability to purchase commodity goods. This in turn would provide better overall living to the lower class population even though in relative terms, their wages would still be on that of the lower end in society. Overall, there would still be a distinction between classes, but there would be more upstanding wealth within the population that would accurately show America’s economic ability under a better GDP per Capita. </p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Giving money to the rich to create jobs has been a failure. Taking money from the rich to give to the poor has been a failure. The only class left relatively untouched has been the middle class. As a result, the only reasonable plan of action left to take is to implement policy centered around the middle class and reap the benefits of economic growth and a universal increase in standard of living.</p>

                <h2>Author's Note</h2>
                <p>The above article was the beginning of a series which will go into depth on the topic of “Taking a Step Towards Solving Wealth Inequality”. The point of the series is to address a plausible solution that is possible to implement within the United States. It does not refer to solving the problem as a whole as wealth inequality will always exist in a free market economy. The next parts of the series will include broad descriptions of the solution, in depth analyses based on current policy, steps for implementation into current policy, possible downsides, and other factors that go into making a in-depth solution. I hope you enjoy the series and keep along this summer as I work through it!</p>
