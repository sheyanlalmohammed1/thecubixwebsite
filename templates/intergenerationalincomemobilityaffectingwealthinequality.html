                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Intergenerational Income Mobility is a term that refers to the ability of an individual to change their position within an economic standpoint during their lifetime. Basically, this idea indicates whether economic circumstances make it more difficult or easier for an individual to move up into higher-income spaces over the course of their lifetime. It also indicates the ability of individuals in an economy to establish independence from one another and familial relationships that would indicate long-term hardships to change income and social classes. The fact that a highly mobile society can be one that contributes positively to the scope of wealth inequality makes it a relevant topic to discuss when it comes to this issue.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Wealth Accumulation</h2>
                <p>The first factor of this issue that is of importance is the effect that intergenerational income mobility has on wealth accumulation. By establishing the precursor that wealth remains stable or in some cases decreases due to limited income mobility, there is the justification for reasoning for its effect on wealth inequality. On a long-term scale, this directly affects the net worth of an individual due to limiting circumstances with the effect being the creation of a class gradient when it comes to wealth value which in turn contributes to social class segregation directly affecting the number of opportunities that are available to certain individuals within these classes. This is a case of inherent inequality when it comes to economic opportunity that limits the growth of an individual, making it relevant to the argument for reform for pay increases and further wealth accumulation having to do with small business growth.</p>
                <p>In order to establish this precursor, there is the need to establish a relationship between the two variables of income variability post college age to pre-retirement age with variability in total wealth accumulation over time. The reason that I am referring to the variability of the variable is that first I want to set the standard that there is a positive connection that comes with an increase in a change in income or less stickiness of incomes on a long term scale with an increased effect of change on wealth value of an individual. By analyzing these two variables we can see if there is a direct or inverse relationship between the two. An inverse relationship would indicate that by making income policies targeted toward making it less concrete in the long term, we are actually negatively impacting the wealth growth of an individual due to a number of other factors that would inherently increase unemployment and further drop wealth the less sticky the wages become. Let’s look at this relationship on an upfront scale. The following graphic is from “Intergenerational Mobility and Income Inequality” by Jörg L. Spenkuch:</p>
                <img>
                <p>The graphic shows the Gini Coefficient, a measure of income inequality, measured against the Intergenerational Earnings Elasticity which indicates the relative amount of change that is expected when it comes to income mobility. In this case, a higher Gini Coefficient shows a greater amount of income inequality while a lower Intergenerational Earnings Elasticity shows greater economic mobility. There is a linear relationship that exists between the two as can be seen. A lower amount of income inequality is synonymous with greater socio-economic mobility. This direct relationship indicated room for improvement for the United States. As seen on the graph above, relative to many of the other nations depicted, the United States lies towards the middle of the spectrum. This means that although we may not have great socio-economic and inequality standpoints such as in Denmark and Norway, we also do not have the same level of inequality that is seen in Brazil and Peru.</p>
                <p>This though does not mean that the circumstances that allow for intergenerational income mobility, income inequality, or wealth inequality are any what justified in their existence in the United States. There are some underlying factors that this graph does not show which indicate the relative inequality that exists in the United States as a result of or related to the intergenerational income mobility of certain sections of the population. By limiting social mobility, the income fluctuations that allow for the crossing of social classes will not occur. Found below is a source from the Washington Center for Equitable Growth:</p>
                <img>
                <p>Why is this relevant when we talk about income and wealth inequality? Well, it is quite obvious that race plays a role in intergenerational income mobility. If we can not inherently provide equal opportunity to all people in the country, we can not solve the problem of inequality at its core. The whole point of this graphic is to show the racial injustice that exists in our economic system. There are 13 spots on this map of over 150 locations depicted in this map that show an equal opportunity for black children to have the same opportunities as white children. That means that as a whole, a measly 9% of black children from 1978-1983 were the only ones given an equal opportunity for success that was not linked to their current living situations. It is not easy to accept the fact that the current workforce made up of these children has an income gap that exists between the two races. Specifically, a gap that I will come back to later in the article.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Social Mobility</h2>
                <p>The main point here is the lack of social mobility has played a factor in the long-term marginalization of achievable opportunities for the African-American population. The important part of policy implementation comes down to the fact that not only the African-American population, but Asians, South Americans, Africans, and Middle Easterns are all examples of increasing populations across the United States as the immigrant population continues to grow as well. The hard truth is all the policies aimed to create equal opportunity for wealth and income inequality only take into account helping U.S. citizens achieve this. This is where my policy is inherently different. My policies are not only directed towards U.S. citizens, they are targeting everyone. I do not want to simply provide opportunities for equal success to all U.S. citizens, I want to provide it to anyone that takes part in our economic system.</p>                
                <p>If you can remember from the “Broad Solution to Solving Wealth Inequality”, I explicitly mentioned that there should be government investment in building further infrastructure that allowed for equal opportunity for citizens. In this case, this would be a policy that is specifically aimed at intergenerational income mobility. By pushing resources to ethnic hotspots that serve as residences to minorities, there would be a greater likelihood of equal opportunity that moves the Gini Coefficient closer to 0. Furthermore, by specifying such resources to combat income discrimination that occurs across both due to background and ethnic reasons, then there would be an emphasis placed on moving that Intergenerational Earnings Elasticity closer to 0 as well.</p>
                <p>First, let’s look at pushing resources to ethnic hotspots. Obviously, those most negatively impacted by intergenerational income inequality are those on the lowest end of the scale since the lack of ease to move between social classes means that if they are born into the bottom of our economic pyramid, it is likely that they will be stuck there. Here is a graphic from “Race and Economic Opportunity in the United States” by Raj Chetty, Nathaniel Hendren, Maggie R. Jones, and Sonya R. Porter that shows race is linked to the average income of adults and their children:</p>
                <img>
                <p>There are a lot of alarming statistics that can be seen on this graph, and some that are beneficial to observing. First, we can clearly see the pattern here as to who is most likely to be in the top and bottom percentiles and where their children are most likely to lie as a result as well. There is a positive correlation that exists between the Parent Household Income Percentiles and the Average Children Household Income Percentile. This indicates that if your parents had high-income levels, there is a very likely chance that you will as well. If they did not, well the opposite remains true. It is very unlikely that you would have a shot at a significantly higher income level. The odds are statistically against you at least. Just how much though? Well, there are some statistics I would like to mention from the work of Mr. Chetty and his colleagues. If you are an African American and are born into the lowest income percentage, you have a 2.5 % chance of reaching the topmost income class. Comparatively, if you are white and in the same circumstances, your chances are significantly better at around 10.6%. What is, even more, enraging besides this statistic is that not only do blacks and American Indians have the lowest rate of upward mobility, but they have the highest rate of downward mobility. What this means is that if you are Black or American Indian and were born into the highest income bracket by your parents, you have the greatest likelihood of falling down to the lowest income class. These statistics are an economic opportunity nightmare, to say the least. Not only do they establish that there is a systematic problem with the current economic opportunity provision system in place, but they also indicate that efforts to reduce the gap may temporarily work, but in the long run, a racial disparity will exist unless a new policy is implemented targeting specific economic policy to reduce the racial gap for opportunity.</p>       
                <p>I want to quickly point out the positive characteristics that can be seen from these statistics. It looks like the intergenerational income mobility of Hispanic is quickly on the rise and nearly aligns with the slope of the mobility for whites, showing that Hispanics have had the most growth of any singular race when it comes to lowering the mobility gap. This is going to be extremely important when it comes to incorporating the economic policy that will be discussed later in the article.</p>
                <p>Simply though, increasing the chances for better income brackets across generations does not come without acknowledging the lack of change in income brackets of the current workforce. There is also the need for acknowledgment of income discrimination that occurs which no doubt affects intergenerational income mobility. Basically, income discrimination means that there is limited ability for adults who lie in one income class to change where they are on the scale due to the established income that they receive is an accurate tell of their worth to the economic system. It is likely the reason that the phrase “the poor stay poor” came to be and it is detrimental to an equal opportunity economic system. Here is a graphic from “Average Income Tends to Rise with Age” by Erica York that shows the percentage change of an adult’s income level after their initial entrance to the workforce.</p>
                <img>
                <p>Now how does this show anything having to do with income discrimination? Well, I would like to put emphasis on two places in the graph. One from the gap from 26 under 35 to 35 under 45 and from 45 under 55 to 55 under 65. Let’s start with the second. As can be observed, it is easy to tell that there is literally almost no change in the average income of an age group that spans almost 20 years wide. It makes sense that pay is linked with age which is linked to efficiency and experience, but the idea of efficiency increases in 20 years with the most experienced members of the workforce having no effect on income levels seems to be negating the increasing values of individuals over time. Simplistically, the idea of income discrimination here is present as more experienced workers are not more likely to receive a substantial pay increase to their younger counterparts. This presents a problem when it comes to establishing a pattern for income behavior when it comes to both youth and older pay increases. For youth specifically, I want to shed light on the most notable time period which is the one mentioned first above. We can observe that the jump here is equal to around a 60% increase in average income. Compared to the nearly 0% a mere 15 years later. This shows that the economic system in place let’s laborers reap the reward of their work ethic only for parts of their employment life which presents a problem when it comes to building wealth as increases in income are correlated to increases in investments and assets which contribute to the wealth accumulation of an individual. This is one of the most important factors that lies within a person’s lifetime that can impact their place on the household income placement index which next is affected by intergenerational income mobility mentioned above.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Combating the Problem</h2>
                <p>By moving individuals from lower and middle-class communities into higher-paying and constantly increasing income jobs, there is the likelihood of greater wealth accumulation in the long-term due to excess income which also can be pushed into the economy in the form of investments and consumption that further increases aggregate demand and motivates companies to increase aggregate supply. This increase in aggregate supply demands more labor to do so which increases employment. Because the velocity of money would be so high, there is also the likelihood that investment policies could be implemented for both firms and individuals. My point is, as a whole, less sticky income in the upward direction would be beneficial to a growing economy.</p>
                <p>Now that scope of effects have been established as being linked to intergenerational income mobility or income stickiness that leads to limited growth, I want to discuss policy that could be used to both lower the effect of this on a general scale, but also within races and ethnicities that are affected by marginalized opportunities. First, let’s discuss policy to counter limited intergenerational income mobility for citizens within lower and lower-middle-class income brackets.</p>
                <p>To do this, we need to talk about generalized infrastructure and the long-term development of low-income and middle-class communities. The goal here is not to create a perfect system of analogous income, but to equalize opportunity for everyone. By initially making it fair as possible while attempting to equalize opportunities, there is the likelihood of taking a needed step forward in fixing wealth inequality in the long term. When it comes to infrastructure, the goal is to increase the ability to achieve higher incomes so the focus goes to education and living circumstances for emerging children. There is the need for equalized access to top-class education on the bottom tax bracket. How is that even achievable? Well, my recommendation would be to create a policy that interfuses the two communities together. The idea is that by pushing lower-income people into affordable housing in higher class regions, there is the likelihood that equal education won’t stand as a problem for many of the struggling lower populations. When it comes to specific race problems, this remains constant. Instead of creating specific race-based regions, make specific policy that relies on equalizing the living circumstances by promoting cross-ethnic multicultural societies. This policy can come in the form of living expense decreases to incentives for the initial charging fee when the living begins. It just depends on the circumstances, but the end goal is the one that is stated.</p>
                <p>I want to look specifically at some economic policies implemented for Hispanic Americans which has led to their incline with intergenerational income mobility. By establishing policies that have proven to work in the long-term to at least align with income mobility, it presents a roadmap that policy makers can use. I am going to look at some of the most notable economic policies that have been targeted at Hispanic populations. Here is the list: Investing in Public Transportation, Addressing affordable housing in strong long-term independent neighborhoods, advancing macroeconomic stability for working people during times of crisis, integration of workplace policies that promote diverse opinions, promotion of a fair and stable financial services market, and contributing to small business growth. Interestingly enough, many of these policies can be carried over to other races. By shifting cultural perspectives and geographically targeted regions for growth based on the race of concern, policy can be implemented for all ethnicities. In the end, it may seem trivial to target small things, such as acceptance of diverse working teams by large firms, but in the long term, the shifting of the Gini Coefficient closer to 0 relies inherently on the fact that all types of people from different social classes, cultural backgrounds, and economic backgrounds be accepted as an equal member of contribution to society. Until this happens, diversity will continue to remain an issue when it comes to income mobility.</p>
                <p>With this being said, this brings me to our next problem to discuss. Combating the stickiness of wages in the long-run which negatively impacts the growth of a person’s wealth. Simplistically stated, the correlation of pay grades based on economic contribution no longer applies when wages see no increase with an increase of economic contribution that comes with experience and a larger workload. Based on the evidence observed in this article, there is an inherent gap that exists in the income discrepancies of new workforce entrants and experienced workers. The lack of steady but notable growth that provides the ability to continue to build wealth is the problem. My solution to combat this relies on the small business employment strategy that was mentioned in “The Broad Solution to Solving Wealth Inequality”. In this specific strategy, I outlined how small business and startup employment from government grants and access to capital and larger markets would directly affect the income of employees. The point was that small businesses have been proven to care more on a personal level with their employees and therefore are more likely to truly understand their living and social circumstances to give them a wage that they can see the employees growth with. Furthermore, the presentation of constant percentage pay increases has the benefit of demarginalizing the income gap that exists between corporate workers and small business workers. The point is that not only will the small businesses workers have better-paying jobs in the long run where their personal living situation is taken into account by the management but they will also have excess income which can be then used for their wealth accumulation activities such as investing or committing to further financial education. These simple things in the long run move lower-income and medium-class people into higher income brackets.</p>
                <p>This move into higher income brackets further increases the chances of upward mobility when it comes to their next of kin with intergenerational income mobility. The idea of the two comes hand in hand for their logistic effect on one another. I believe by taking at least some of the policy suggestions outlined above, there is the ability to reduce the income inequality that we see as a large factor in the evidence outlined above and take a step towards bettering wealth inequality in the United States.</p>
