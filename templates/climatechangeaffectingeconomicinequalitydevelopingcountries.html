                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>In the last portion of the series, I began explaining the effects of climate change in the short and long run to developed countries in terms of their economies. This time, I will be doing the same except it will be for the economies of developing nations. Arguably, the effects of climate change are a lot more detrimental to the economies of these nations which have yet to develop a stable form of output for their citizens to increase their quality of life. The effects of climate change and carbon outputs could permanently stifle the progress of these countries from the last half-century.</p>
                <p>I want to first address a common misconception when it comes to climate change concerning developing nations. The concept of climate change is seen as affecting these nations the most due to the carbon emissions that are sent toward them from the developed nations that surround them. While developed nations do contribute a very large portion of the global carbon emissions when measured with a percentage of contribution index, they do not contribute anywhere near the full amount. According to the Center for Global Development, developing countries make up about 40% of global emissions. This means that while they may be the most affected when it comes to the dangers of climate change to the development of the global economy, they are also one of the most avid contributors to their positions. Some examples of these regions and countries that are contributing a majority of their emissions are in Southeast Asia, Northern Africa, the Middle East, and some of Sub-Saharan Africa. While I will make the distinction about which parts of their emissions habits are due to western influence and their importance to the manufacturing industry worldwide, it is important to understand that many of these countries do know that they are in this situation and are voluntarily contributing to their economic downfall for the future.</p>
                <p>The next thing I want to address is describing what I am considering a developing country may be unlike the generally accepted list of developing countries. I am specifically looking at developing economies. Many so-called “developing countries” have stable economic output but the majority of their social circumstances impact the quality of life for the citizens. In this case, a country is still developing, but its economy can be considered developed since a relationship has already been created in the global economy that creates demands for its products. Some of the specific circumstances that I consider making the economy “developing” is in regards to its service, manufacturing, and financial sector along with workforce education development. These economies specifically are not known for their service development. They are likely to be dependent on manufacturing industries that use external company suppliers to motivate financial interests outside the country with little addition to the overall wellbeing of the economy. They also have an unstable financial market or possibly no financial market at all. What this means is that there is no financial institution, commercial banks, or a widely available federal bank that handles the money supply efficiently and opens access to all citizens in order to promote investment and the internal development of the economy. Without this, it is common to see the creation of informal markets or what we call an “informal economy” which just means that transactions between the majority of individuals are not able to be tracked or considered by the government which has led to arguments about the validity of their GDP and if the gap between developing and developed economies is as great as the numbers make it seem. Lastly, these economies have unskilled labor forces which do create the circumstances for manufacturing development in the region that is meant to take advantage of the labor for higher production capabilities due to reducing costs through outsourcing. The important thing to remember is that the developing economies have very loose infrastructure and the little they do have is now at long-term risk with increasing temperatures caused by climate change.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Short-Term Effects</h2>
                <p>Before we address the long-term risks of climate change on such countries. I want to look at the short-term effects of climate change that have already affected such economies and serve as a precursor for the dangers that carbon emissions present for the future of these economies. The most important and detrimental short-term effects include increased internal and external conflict in certain geographical regions, food and water insecurity, and economic development. These short-term effects of climate change have been put in motion years in advance and represent a continuation of the current negligent policy of degrading the quality of life in many developing countries.</p>
                <p>The first notable effect that would come about within a relatively short time period is the increased external and internal conflicts in low-income or low-output geographical regions. Some specific regions would be South-East Asia, the Middle East, Central Africa, Southern Africa, and the majority of South America. While these regions have had substantial reaches in urban development, they still struggle to efficiently maintain violent groups from strong-arming the government and local populations. Some specific groups that have set up militias with access to resources in these regions include the National Liberation Army in South America, the KwaZulu Natal in Southern Africa, the Central African National Liberation Movement in Central Africa, and the People’s militia forces of South-East Asia. These military movements have set up strategic military points near or within urban regions that deal with resource distribution in their respective countries or regions. It is likely that with the continuously increasing temperatures, the war for resources that will become scarce is only set to increase. Recently, there has been an uptick of violent interaction due to the pandemic which created a supply shock globally. This result is similar to that of the militia groups under extenuating circumstances such as resource consumption having to do with climate change. While it is likely that the majority of these groups won’t aggravate other militia groups, there will be internal movements to power as citizens of low-income or developing countries must look to militias for getting the materials they need in order to survive from the majority of their corrupt regimes or governments in place. It is likely that the increased internal conflict will soon expand to the entirety of the region as competing countries target one another for economic resources to be used in the global trade network as a last resort of obtaining the resources that have come from urban development during the last two decades or so in these countries.</p>
                <p>The next short-term effect of climate change on developing economies is food and water insecurity. It is no surprise that developing countries have had recent problems with getting adequate amounts of water and food to their citizens. These countries lack the urban infrastructure that connects large bodies of water and creates supply chains for agricultural or cultivated food products to reach major population centers. As a result, in recent years it has become common for famine to be widespread in these population centers and the majority of the populations being considered below good health standards comes as a result of the lack of these integral infrastructure connections. While the development of urban regions in these countries has recently expanded, climate change presents a looming threat to the essential resource distribution to populations beyond close distances from the major water and agricultural supplies. Using an econometric test to find a mean target range for distance from current urban centers that would be the most affected to an increase in the demand for essential resources in Southern and Central Africa, I discerned that the majority of the populations affected would sit somewhere beyond a 150-mile radius of the major cities in their region. If those populations, were to sit in the direction of the equator, it would be further detrimental as the cost of supply movement only goes up with temperature differences. Unsurprisingly, there was also a correlation between relative distance and health standards that was statistically significant in the 95% confidence interval from its mean. This correlation indicates that health standards continue to decrease the farther from urban centers the population moves. It represents an amazing argument for urbanization in these developing countries, but more importantly, it represents the danger that climate change would impact these countries. Climate change is undoubtedly going to continue to lead to clean water corrosion for the near future, and it has already led to a drastic in usable forms of fresh water in Southern Asia and South Africa. It also has motivated the indirect pollution of water supply in the Middle East through oil drilling efforts along the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. Furthermore, the limited agricultural supply has led to a multitude of health and economic effects on the local populations. The problem with agricultural supply is not the production since many of these developing countries have excess supply due to their reliance on subsistence farming. It is instead the fact that trade imbalances will continue to increase, meaning that resource consumption from developing countries will continue to decrease as they continue ,in majorly crop-based exports decline on a global scale, creating further supply shocks for food security in both their borders and their trade partners. Of course, for now, climate change has decreased crop yields and freshwater supply significantly in developing regions, but it is only a taste of what is to come. According to the World Economic Report by the World Bank, we can expect to see an exponential decline of these yields within the next decade, meaning that the likelihood of starvation and widespread dehydration is a real reality.</p>
                <p>The last short-term effect of climate change on developing economies is the decline of economic output. We have established the fact that there will likely be shortages of essential goods across the country, but we have not talked about manufacturing. Developing economies remain the greatest greenhouse gas contributors in the world economy, contributing about 40% of consumer goods due to their attraction of foreign services through cheap labor and startup costs with unstable currency exchange rates. The only problem with this comes in the form of manufacturing costs increasing due to climate change. According to a study done by the Urban Institute into matriculating worker wages in developing countries, there has been an uptick in worker wages within the last 5 years that contributes to increasing prices for consumer goods. With increased forms of development with educational infrastructure, workers who would have likely worked in factories have moved to receive an education to possibly contribute to the growing service sector that comes with worker development. Greenhouse gas emission only motivates this switch more as the conditions for working long hours in increasing temperatures become less doable and maintainable for the majority of workers. The vast majority of the output for these countries involves manufactured goods that rely on those workers. In the long term, it may seem like a great idea to switch to a service-based industry that has served countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom well, but the smooth process of transition must occur from natural increases in infrastructure instead of cyclical unemployment. As a result, climate change will continue to decrease worker participation in developing economies which will create a trade gap with developed countries and slow down the foreign investment coming into many of these countries which would continue to decrease output. It works as a continuous paradox relying on natural worker habits in the short term.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Long-Term Effects</h2>
                <p>Long-Term effects are even more destructive than the short-term effects if they were to continue in the motion that they are heading in. Notable long-term effects of climate change on developing economies at the current pace include permanent damage to essential trading routes and ports for manufactured goods, lack of business diversity, and decreased worker productivity and development. Long-term effects of climate change are treading dangerously close to economic collapse within a half-century for many of the countries who have spent centuries creating an immense economic infrastructure, whether that be informal or formal. These effects can prove to be the defining factors in what many economists predict to be an economic collapse in the upcoming decades.</p>
                <p>The first long-term effect that must be addressed is the environmental portion of economics that has led to current globalization under a combined network of trade policies and open markets that have opened up non-physical borders to cross-country reliance. The majority of these connections take place through physical trade ports and hubs that run through major manufacturing economies. As established earlier, developing economies are also primarily manufacturing economies which means they will be the hardest hit by environmental changes to their trade infrastructure that is already somewhat loose and reliant on outside forces. According to the book “Why Nations Fail” by Charles Mann, the primary reason for economic adaptations that have led to current trade and wealth imbalances can be explained simply by the geography of the country and the way its location impacts its production capabilities within the economy and its culture impacts the ability to participate in the given economy. Specific trade routes that developing countries currently rely on for the little geographically strategic positioning they do have are the Panama Canal, Strait of Hormuz, Suez Canal, Silk Road, Trans-Saharan African Route, and the Salt Route.  These routes are all subject to change due to rising temperatures as ports will slow down due to infrastructure changes, there will be more manpower and resources to use land routes, and major pathways may have to be restructured with changing globalization of current trade routes. The truth is that these changes in the long-term are more environmental than economics as honestly, this effect would lead to further employment and urbanization as infrastructure development became a big part of developing countries who want to keep up with environmental changes.</p>
                <p>The next long-term effect of continued increases in pollution levels includes a lack of business diversity. Classical economics states that over time, with no government intervention, businesses that meet consumer needs will be established and maintained to make profits. Now, this is true with means. The keyword here being means, many of which developing countries do not have. For example, an extreme case is financial institutions that give access to all citizens for a financial holding account. Many developing countries lack this basic institution because they do not have the technological development infrastructure required to make use of it. For that reason, I theoretically believe long-term business diversity will work the same way in many developing countries concerning supply chains that impact business growth with lackluster resources being used domestically by the country. The law of supply and demand states that with a decrease in resources, in this case, linked to environmental harm, there will be a reduction in aggregate supply globally which means that with demand staying relatively constant, there should be an increase in the price level for all goods. What this means is that capital goods used for business development would be overpriced compared to the affordable value for developing economies. These capital goods represent ways that technological development happens as they can be used to develop manufacturing infrastructure in the long run. Essentially, higher prices limit access to capital goods which slow down technological development and reduce the means by which certain products can be produced which means that certain businesses cannot exist. This lack of equilibrium also impacts international money exchanges as there is the motivation for promoting international trade development over domestic development since the increase in money inflow presents a more lucrative opportunity for investment of resources. This negatively impacts long-term domestic development that is necessary for developing countries to continue to close the wealth gap between themselves and developed countries.</p>
                <p>The last long-term and lasting effect of climate change on developing economies is decreased worker productivity and development. I like to call this worker output. Instead of thinking about GDP per capita, this number only counts the eligible workforce when considering output. The goal is of course to gain the maximum amount of worker productivity for product creation by developing countries. Of course, this works as a production possibilities matrix in that the limit is different for each country, but for a developing country, we can assume they would be towards the middle of the index. This means that with some technological infrastructure, most production is still reliant on physical labor. When measuring worker output, this number would be then inherently affected by climate change due to the negative human effect on the physical labor needed to maintain an efficient output from a given developing economy. This is worse than the effect of developed countries due to differences in economic infrastructure. Most of the economy in developed countries is service-based which means that the majority of human interaction in the economy is done through interaction with other humans. This is something that can easily be done through a different setting. On the other hand, developing economies cannot replace a burnt-out workforce for others to contribute to physical labor, and even when they do, domestic resource availability will still be slim at best due to the higher pricing referred to earlier. This workforce reduction leads to increased strain on the active workforce to meet production standards that are inherently unachievable for long periods of time which further increases burnout and decreases the likelihood of side profitability of workers through investment within their education or ability to look for an alternate industry or specialize. It creates a paradox that sticks in a loop until the majority of the workforce can get involved again which is very unlikely with the rising temperatures and reduced air quality.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Overall, as is easily seen, the short-term and long-term development of developing economies takes a large toll due to climate change caused by themselves. It is interesting how the world has simply left these countries with limited options to the point where they must contribute to their own demise to maintain a living standard. In some cases, it may not even be considered liveable but just standards in themselves. The good news is that there is a policy change that can be used in order to combat some of the short-term effects and many of the long-term effects. In reference to climate change in itself, it is easier to combat long-term effects since the process can be started now and see results years later whereas short-term effects are primarily ongoing and unlikely to respond to direct changes in the markets today. In the next part of the climate change series, I will break down some of the past methods proposed to combat the economic effects of climate change as well as provide some of my own suggestions based on my research of the topic. Thank you for reading and stay tuned!</p>
