                <h2>Explanation of Theory</h2>
                <p>Monetary value of goods and services have increased every year, every decade, and every century for as long as the term monetary has been around. This is due to inflation. Inflation, in this case, refers to the decrease in value to all terms of monetary items. This not only refers to currency, but to items that hold monetary value in relation to value of supplemental being as well. A concept that will be dwelled upon later in the study. Now inflation has been attributed too many concepts such as competition, increase in debt, increase in interest rates, over-speculation by the government, and market collapses or recession. This is where an interesting take comes in. Economists agree with the fact that there is a way for political organization to decrease the rate of inflation. This form of policy comes in a different way as there is no actual action but rather a belief or opinion put out by the lawmakers that can combat the problem. This opinion, in simple wording, is the idea that to decrease inflation, lawmakers must convince the people that inflation will not be high. This idealism constitutes a fact that cannot be directly measured by any means, but it does arouse a number of questions. Is the qualification of the theory a basis for analysis into direct growth of inflation? Is inflation attributed to the expectation of inflation? These concepts seem intertwined at first but attribute to a larger expectation of inflation in direct connection. This connection refers to a powerful idea that controls notions of the future of inflation. The people’s thoughts control inflation. To elaborate on this claim, let me simplify the expression in logical terms. I am attempting to argue that the mere thought of inflation being high or low impacts inflation in the future by doing exactly what the people think.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Analysis of Reasoning and Hypothetical Argument</h2>
                <p>As stated above, there is a lack of direct connection and absence of a scale of measurement as to establish a correlation between thoughts and inflation in immediate terms. This is the proposition of the study though as I believe a direct line can be passed through the actions of large monetary movement to and from the hands of the people. There is an involvement of the government that influences the thoughts of the people as mentioned above. These thoughts then constitute a number of actions that thus incite the rate of inflation to either increase or decrease which is dependent on actions relating to or in line with large monetary value into the lives of consumers. This rate represents a crucial value to lawmakers as they speculate the entirety of the future of the economy in relative terms of their numerical monetary value. This of course is just a claim. A claim which without evidence is rendered useless. Therefore in order to qualify, build upon, and improve this claim, we will look to an abundance of figures and quotations to inductively create this claim from a blank whiteboard and solidify it with the purpose of development of an estimation of inflation rate that draws back to citizens and their thought process.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Expectation of the Study</h2>
                <p>Theories are more or less incompetent unless able to bet used in a practical sense of endeavor, so to furthermore draw upon the argument of consumer based thinking in relation to inflation rates, a practical study involving current industrial climate could be used. An examination of current political policies as well as the common citizen thought in terms of monetary value in relation with the movement of large monetary value into the lives of American citizens, would prove a practical relation between the two. In order to measure accuracy, the rate of inflation that would come out in terms of the study would be related to that of the World Bank’s “Global Economic Outlook”. This study will be referenced in the evidence portion as it constitutes a majority of the data released about overall economic development, including the effects of inflation.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Place of Evidence</h2>
                <p>Evidence must clearly show a relation between two fundamentally different concepts. See, to constitute a theory, there must be a clear influx of evidence that will establish a correlation between thought and inflation. Now, because one can only be measured in numerical value while the other is a concept that constantly changes with no evidence as to support why, there must be two completely different concepts of trial in order to constitute a difference between changes in one and the effect on the other. Most would change the numerical value of the inflation rate and trace it back to the thoughts of consumers. This though, would prove to be ineffective since in order to establish a concrete theory as multiple steps of action could lead to a single result from the point of view of the citizens. Rather, I aim to establish two points of thought and delve on the course of logical action that would result in the increase or decrease in the inflation rate. These two points of thought are to be examined as follows. One will establish the thought of a relatively small amount of monetary influx for the year and the other will be the thought of a relatively large amount of monetary influx for the year. In both cases, evidence will be provided in two forms. One form, referred to in future sections as “Evidence for Analysis”, will establish a basis of reasoning based on evidence using inductive methods of investigation. This evidence will be used to create a claim that is solely based on the evidence, a concept referred to as the “Rough Theory”. This claim will be put into practical terms in order to be constituted as a candidate of the established theory by referring to practical application in the second form of evidence, referred to as “Evidence in Practice”. This evidence will draw on already established numbers and actions and the effects they have caused but attempt to create similar conditions with the introduction of the said claim. If able to redeem relatively similar results in terms of inflation, and align with evidence presented in the analysis portion, the Theory would hold a practical application and therefore would constitute that “The Thought of Inflation” does indeed affect inflation.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Evidence for Analysis</h2>
                <p>The following portion of evidence is presented with the intent of inductively creating a claim. Numerical, concrete data will be shown and analyzed first to create a basis for claim which is qualified with the introduction of qualitative, perspective-based data. To begin with, we are going to focus on four specific figures to establish the effects of the thought of a relatively small amount of monetary influx for the year. Let’s start with Figure 1.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Figure 1:</h2>
                <h3>Graph 1:</h3>
                <img>
                <h3>Graph 2:</h3>
                <img>
                <h3>Table:</h3>
                <img>
                <br>
                <h2>Analysis of Evidence</h2>
                <p>We must first reference the table above. This table concisely the correlation coefficient between a number of currency and economic indicators. One line in particular is of interest to the study. This row would be the one labeled “MZM” and within the row, the column of focus is the one labeled “PCI Infl.” These two pieces have a correlation coefficient of greater than 0.7, indicating that they have a moderately strong correlation with one another. The MZM refers to the velocity of money within the economy. This may seem like the rate at which money changes hands, but specifically I would like to emphasize that it is merely referencing the building of credit. The MZM is basically the amount of money at hand in a liquidized state at any current point within the economy. It measures readily available cash from bills and banknotes, checking, savings and money market accounts. The PCI Inf. is actually representing inflation based on the Price and Consumer Index. This is just inflation in basic terms. Now, I would like to direct attention to the first graph above, the MZM plotted against the Effective Federal Funds Rate. The effective federal funds rate is the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans to meet their reserve requirements. Also known as the federal funds rate, the effective federal funds rate is set by the Federal Open Market Committee. This rate is an interest rate, which fluctuates based on market conditions and is changing constantly. It’s fluctuation is not of interest, I want to focus attention on the fact that it follows nearly the same trends as the MZM and the fact that drops and increases are nearly aligned just not with the drastic measures that are unique to the Effective Federal Funds Rate. This point is important to the claim as a whole as will be explained. Now, please direct attention to the second graph in which MZM is plotted against the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items. This just shows inflation as the changes in prices are attributed to the concept. The reference of this graph which is important is the trends that are recognizable with MZM. From what analysis can tell you, the synced movement between the two has a moderately strong correlation meaning that as the MZM moves in a positive direction, as does the inflation of consumer goods because prices go up, and as the MZM moves in a negative direction, as does the inflation as prices begin to tumble.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Figure 2:</h2>
                <img>
                <h2>Evidence Analysis</h2>
                <p>Figure 2 details an equation known as the Equation of Exchange within the Quantity theory of money. It has four components as labeled above which are “M” or the Money Supply, “V” or the Velocity of Money, “P” or the Average Price Level, and “Q” which in this case will be the real GDP of the economy. This equation is a difficult concept to grasp, but I am going to do my best to break it down, just enough to emphasize the information which it entails. Though looking simple with its four factors, each factor characterizes an undefined relationship of sorts. First, let’s look at money supply, this is simply the amount of money readily available in the hands of people over the course of a defined time period. Then, we have the velocity of money, this time simply measuring the amount of times that the money changes hands from consumers to producers. Next, we have the average price level, this is the amount of money that an average good or service costs on a relative scale to what it is actually worth statistically based on supply and demand. The most common general price level is based on the CPI (Consumer Price Index). Lastly, the Q is going to refer to the real GDP, the real GDP is an inflation-adjusted measure that reflects the value of all goods and services produced by an economy in a given year (expressed in base-year prices). To simplify it a bit more, consider the right side of the equation (the side with P and Q) as being shown of the producers’ output, and the left side of the equation (the side with M and V) shows the consumers’ output. Just for the explanation of it, I’m going to explain why. Starting with the left side, these money supply and velocity of money depend entirely on the consumer’s as the money supply is the cash reserve which the consumers hold and the velocity of money is the rate at which they spend or move that cash supply into the hands of the producers. With the right side, simply put, the goods and services sold are produced by the producers and the overall value of these goods is the real GDP (can also be considered as the total value of all final produced products), and the price level of these goods and services is put into place by the producers as well. With a thorough connection developed between the two, we are going to neutralize the parts of the equation that do not support concrete evidence. The two parts which I am going to take out of account are the velocity of money and the real GDP. The reason being that economists can agree that in a healthy economy, these two values will be, at least in theory, constant. Macroeconomics supports this on a fundamental level, but it is not pertinent to our discussion. What I would like to put attention to is the Money supply and the Price Level. These two, in statistical terms, should directly impact one another in the case of the Equation of Exchange. If the money supply goes up, then so should the Price Level and vice versa. This works in effect with what was stated above in Figure 1.</p>

                <h2>Evidence Analysis</h2>
                <p>Figure 3 shows three different charts. The top graph details the inflation rate from the year 2000 to now. Then the bottom graph indicates the relationship between supply and demand, in terms of the calculation of the equilibrium price. Now to establish a connection, we must look at a specific section of the chart detailing the inflation rate in response to real time events. I want to turn to two specific events which can offer opposing data points. One being the Katrina Spike and the other being the deflation in the 2009 recession. Why did the inflation peak after Hurricane Katrina in relation to supply and demand and why did it drop rapidly in the recession of 2009 because of supply and demand? This is the question that the evidence will answer. First, I would like to explain the concept of supply and demand on inflation. To do that, first I would like to bring attention to the second graph. The calculation of the Equilibrium price. I want to establish how the equilibrium price is to be calculated in relation to supply and demand. These concepts are fundamentally tied to the concept of inflation. Supply refers to the total number of completed products that are on the market, and the demand is the relative number of people who have interest in the product at that price point or in general. In the second graph it is detailed as to what happens when the supply is increased as demand remains the same. In the case that this happens, the equilibrium price, the price at which supply meets demand, will fall. This is because there is a surplus of product without an increase in consumers, prompting businesses to drop prices in order to meet returns on investment. Now to further the idea of supply and demand impacting price levels, we will refer to a concept called Demand-Pull Inflation. This is shown in graphs 3 and 4. In these graphs, there are four concepts. The reference of “AD” is aggregate demand, better defined as an economic measurement of the total amount of demand for all finished goods and services produced in an economy. It may also be defined as the total amount of money exchanged for those goods and services at a specific price level and point in time. Then there is the reference to the “SRAS”, called short-run aggregate supply curve. Aggregate supply is defined as the total supply of goods and services that firms in a national economy plan to sell during a specific time period. It is the total amount of goods and services that the firms are willing to sell at a given price level in the economy. There is one reason why this supply is shown in a curve. The curve increases because some nominal input prices are fixed in the short-run and as output rises, more production processes encounter bottlenecks. At low levels of demand, large numbers of production processes do not make full use of their fixed capital equipment. As a result, production can be increased without much diminishing returns. The average price level does not have to rise much in order to justify increased production. In this case, the AS curve is flat. Likewise, when demand is high, there are few production processes that have unemployed fixed outputs. Any increase in demand production causes the prices to increase which results in a steep AS curve. This production output method takes into effect the idea that there is only a certain number of ways to increase production, and once a limit of production capacity is reached, a continued increase in demand will cause a drastic increase in price. The last two concepts are those which have been discussed before, the “PL” or Price Level and the “RGDP” or the Real Gross Domestic Product.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Figure 4:</h2>
                <h3>Graphs 1 and 2:</h3>
                <img>
                <h2>Evidence Analysis</h2>
                <p>Figure 4 exemplifies the term “inflationary psychology” or the idea that inflation increases in excess amounts when perceived inflation is higher. Within the rationale of thinking for consumers, inflation is imminent, and so inflation will nearly never be perceived as being negative, better known as deflation. Rather, periods of deflation will perceive inflation in lower quantities and relatively smaller distribution and range than that of periods of inflation. This is shown through the first two graphs above. We can see that on the left the graph labeled “deflationary period” which shows what the general consumer consensus was on the level of inflation in the U.S. economy during a period of deflation. We can see that the all outstanding opinions add up to 100% relative frequency. Meaning that all bars on both charts add up to 100%, giving us an accurate representation of the total population. To begin with, the chart with the deflationary period has some notable characteristics. Nearly half of the population assumed that inflation would be minimal somewhere in the 0-5 range, which is about average. This means that the people believed that there was just about normal inflation because as a rule of thumb, it is uncommon for any population to ever believe that money will increase in value or prices will drop as many are used to the linear combination of the Consumer Price Index. This can be countered with the phycology during an inflationary period as shown above. The graph clearly shows that while around 18% of the population believes that inflation will stay within the 0-5 range, there is clearly an increase in the relative average of the graph towards the 10-15 range which opens up a new interesting topic as to why there is a greater movement toward an attitude of inflation which creates inflation. The increased average signals that there is a bigger general concern and an increase of risk percentage overall in the economy and creates an opportunity for inflation to truly to take place. The graphs indicate a clear and concise difference between the two situations and therefore explain why there can be supporting evidence for a theory.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Evidence in Practice</h2>
                <h3>Figure 1:</h3>
                <h4>Graph 1:</h4>
                <img>
                <h4>Graph 2:</h4>
                <h2>Analysis of Evidence</h2>
                <p>As per the basis of the following evidence in correlation with inflation as a whole for the United States. The goal of the above graphs is to establish and maintain the total inflation with account to industries and consumer spending throughout the months in which the Coronavirus took place. The reason for this specific evidence is that over the course of the last year, there has been both inflationary and deflationary periods due to advancements in government policy meant to counter the effects of COVID on the economy. The general consensus was that because of the recession, there would be a period of deflation due to consumer spending, but with the passing of certain policies, such as the Stimulus Packages, the treasury chose to print massive amounts of money that fueled the worry of inflation far more than in past years. This is all shown in the graphs above as I will explain. Within Graph 1 above, there is the overall consensus of CPI (Consumer Price Index or Inflation), but it is defined in terms of significant consumer spending with the three categories being food, energy, and general spending. I want to focus on a specific portion of the graph which would be from the year 2020 and onwards as that is all that we are interested in. The overall percentage of inflation can be broken into parts as has been done on the graph. These percentages should be consistent whether they go up and down in a state of stability. Unfortunately, we were not in a state of stability during the pandemic and for that reason their are significant changes in the makeup of overall price inflation. For one, we can look at the price level of food before the pandemic. The general consensus or average increase in the Consumer Price Index subset of Food Contribution was a measly 0.3%. Looking toward a time of the pandemic. The contribution to the CPI increased drastically to even cover 0.7% at one point during the original recession and remained in bigger proportions throughout the pandemic. We will get to the reason later, but I thought I would point it out. Furthermore, the price of energy which includes natural gas and oil actually made negative contributions to the CPI. In other words, they were deflationary up to 1.1% which is an abnormal and large amount for a single quantity of good. This changed later in the year as we saw the Energy Contribution spike later in the year. A significant change no doubt. One which is important to my point, but again that’s for the next graph.</p>
                <p>Speaking of the next graph, let’s take a look at Graph 2. This one details the change in consumer spending I referred to earlier. An accurate picture of spending is showcased for the year of 2020 which is our main focus. I want to specifically first look at exactly what industries are being shown in the graph above. We have Grocery (referring to retail markets for food), Hotels and Restaurants (referring to the Travel and Tourism industry), Transport and Warehousing (referring to all inclusive transportation and provisional storage spending), and Entertainment and Recreation (shouldn’t have to expand on this one, it’s your fun places). The three specific cases we will once again be referring to are Food (in this case Grocery), Energy (in this case Transport and Warehousing by direct relation), and all consumer spending. In the last graph, there was an establishment of the idea that the contribution for these three categories had variations that were not in line with usual contributions to the CPI. In this graph, we can see first with Grocery, there is an increase in overall demand due to the increase in Consumer spending as people prioritized making food towards the beginning of the pandemic and continuing throughout the year. It never dipped once into negative consumer spending territory. As a result of increased demand, the price of certain foods (Ex: Milk and Eggs) became inflationary as described by the law of supply and demand as supply and production were not ramped up in response to the increasing demand. Moving to the Transport and Warehousing part of the graph, there was the second largest drop in consumer spending after the beginning of the pandemic. As a result, the overall supply of energy based products, such as oil and natural gas, continued to increase while demand dropped significantly. With the short term aggregate supply curve, we can see that there would be an overall decrease in price which is in line with the negative contribution Energy made to the CPI in Graph 1. Lastly, with total core contribution, there is still meant to be inflation because of the decrease in the total production of goods due to harder financial times. This means that though there was inflation, the core contribution wasn’t nearly as high as it would have been in some years due to a drop in demand for leisure products and services. The result is net inflation being above 0 which goes to show economic resilience of the country.</p>
                <p>The last part of the graph that I would like to point out is the fact that there was a recovery. Graph 2 shows the recovery taking place till July 2020 and that can be seen within the high increase inflation during the middle of 2020. The result of what could be pointed to consumer thoughts and policy working together. A topic that is further discussed in Figure 2.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Figure 2:</h2>

                <h2>Analysis of Evidence</h2>
                <p>Figure two contains two graphs similar to Figure 1. In this case the place of evidence will be to establish the idea that inflation thoughts contributed to a change in actual inflation, furthering the idea of that inflationary psychology plays a role in the eventual increase of inflation in practical circumstances shown in Figure 4 of the “Evidence for Analysis” Section. To begin with, let’s take a look at figure 1. The notable characteristics that can be seen is a clear overall breakdown of inflation on a yearly scale, into monthly parts. The actual length of the bars do not actually mean the rate of inflation within that month itself, but the month’s part in the inflation created on top of the previous inflation that already existed. It’s a compounded show of inflation broken into time based parts as a summary. Graph 2 represents a survey taken by the Global Fund Manager toward American Investors that are part of the general public. The two months of interest we would like to compare under similar stress of crisis would be January 2021 and February 2021 which are the last two columns on Graph 1.</p>
                <p>In Graph 1, it is more than clear that there is a difference in the month over month inflation rate from January to February. January 2021 had a clear 1.4% inflation while the inflation in February had jumped to 1.7%. A clear increase that had not been seen since July to August of the year before. Why exactly did it happen though, there are a multitude of reasons, but I want to focus on one in particular which is inflationary phycology. American Investors usually move the Market and Economy in a certain direction so they can create and control panic and stability within the Economy. Well in Graph 2, we can see that the American Investors had a generally high consensus as it was that inflation was going to be a problem in January of 2021 similar to that of December 2020(not shown). The general consensus that it was going to be the largest problem though sat under the Vaccine roll out at a modest 25% of investors stating it. Well in February 2020, the percentage of investors that said that inflation could be the largest problem was up to 37%, about 12% higher than it had been a month ago. This signals in a change in inflationary phycology by the American Investors that correlates to the month over month change in inflation. The January 2021 inflation is less than the February 2021 inflation which was the same as the general consensus of whether inflation would be higher or lower in the survey.</p>
                <p>What this really shows is that the people had an effect on inflation. Amid a larger amass of panic and further stimulus being passed, there was a general consensus that inflation was going to make the prices soar which resulted in actual inflation being higher. The next section, the theory will take this example and explain why it is correct.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>The Theory</h2>
                <p>Let me begin by reiterating my original claim that inflation can be caused by the mere expectation of inflation to go up. Basically stating that only in the positive and somewhat negative direction, inflation is controlled by the people in a state of nonactive control that allows for movement in the direction that comes from a general consensus of such direction. In simple words, people unknowingly make inflation go up and down based on whether they think it will be high or low in that time frame.</p>
                <p>The overwhelming amount of practical and analytical evidence proves to be in support of the concept of this stated as inflationary psychology. In this case, the definition of the term meaning the claim of the study. The point was to prove whether the concept is true or not. I can now say with confidence that it is. Let’s run back and explain how I got to this conclusion.</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>I looked at the MZM Stock and the Consumer Price Index and what exactly the correlation was between the two and what exactly the meaning of the two were in order to identify a relationship. That relationship being that their movements were nearly lined up.</li>
                  <li>Branching of the idea of the MZM and Inflation, I was brought to the Equation of Exchange in where I was able to decipher that the velocity of money and the money supply were both direct equated to inflation as if either were increased or decreased, there would be changes to inflation. I also established what the price level would represent in the equation as inflation.</li>
                  <li>Moving off the idea of price level, I figured out how it was calculated in relation to the law of supply and demand. I established the needs of the SRAS and how it could impact the price level and create short term inflation as well as how aggregate demand affected the economy.</li>
                  <li>Speaking of the Economy, I looked how it reacted in terms of expectations of the CPI/Inflation in times of Inflation and Deflation. I was able to establish that there was a clear connection between a change of mindset between the two which brought up the possibility of a link between thought and inflation.</li>
                  <li>To set up a change in the mindset between the two mindsets, I used COVID-19 as an example of how some products went up and down in value based on consumer mindset. Some examples that I used were Energy (deflationary), Travel (deflationary), and Grocery (inflationary).</li>
                  <li>To continue from the point of COVID, we took a real life example of a relatively significant change in inflation and put it against an easy to-see example of change in mindset of inflation. We were finally able to see the entire process in effect and establish its presence.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This isn’t the end of it. There’s no point of deciphering a theory unless it can actually be used to come up with anything useful. In this case, it is the prediction of inflation based on consumer confidence. The proving of the famous economic concept of consumer mindset and inflation presents an opportunity to be used to decipher that mindset and get a roughly accurate reading of the way that inflation will go and at the pace it will change. Will it be major? Minor? Large? Small? Maybe deflation happens? Getting a starting concept with the theory would be its best use for future predictions about inflation. It has a use after all!</p>
