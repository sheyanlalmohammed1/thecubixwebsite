                  <h2 style="text-align: center; font-weight: 400;"><em>By: Sheyan Lalmohammed on June 22, 2021</em></h2>
                </div>
                <br>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The solution to solving wealth inequality must be effective and efficient in order to sustainably alter the wealth and economic landscape of the nation. To complete a pure transition of wealth, the solution must be inclusive of political views and in line with policy implementation, spending limits, political authority, economic stature, financial welfare, institutional ability to meet basic needs, education policy, labor standards, job security, gender roles, racial equality, economic policy, money saturation, seperation of labor, advancement in industry, accepted working conditions, debt management, organization responsibilities, and so many other factors that have to be taken into account when thinking about changing the landscape of wealth capacity, or concentration, from one class to another.</p>
                <p>As stated within the introduction, the solution revolves around providing the majority of the nation’s wealth to the middle class citizens in order to bulk up small business growth and expand opportunities for the lower class. The solution is by no means simple to implement or expand upon once it is stated. Furthermore, the slightest bit of error in implementation could result in an economic recession which would mean near economic collapse for the United States current financial and employment infrastructure. With that being stated, if the solution were to be implemented and expanded around within the ways listed in this series, the economic and wealth landscape of the United States would never be the same again. There would be a class difference but one in which the majority of citizens could lead happy and peaceful lives free of struggle and poverty. The solution begins below, and it is very intertwined so there is a need for attentive connectedness in the following pages. Time to begin.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Industries</h2>
                <p>To start, establishing industry guidelines in areas where wealth can be better based or handled would be exceptional towards moving to an equal wealth structure within those industries. The problem though comes in the fact that certain industries are better developed and monopolized for certain corporations. These corporations hold large leverage in the industry that would be extremely difficult to offset by new small businesses. The access to resources, access to technological advancement in a rapid setting, and an international platform gives these large corporations a setting in which they have market and logistical advantages over small businesses. Some notable examples of industries are technology and energy. These industries are difficult due to resources and branding. For technology, large corporations have hardware spread across the globe that is used for the majority of business practices, but the software is incompatible with expanding interfaces which makes it difficult for small businesses and startups, even those who focus solely on software implementation, to jump into a competitive placement. For energy, it comes down to resource allocation and industrial investment. Large energy corporations have access to capital that allows worldwide resource allocation and they regularly invest in expanding industrial operations across the globe which makes just about any startup company’s hope of success nonexistent. This leads to the point of industry targeting within wealth management. The biggest industries are those that have tough competition, so the goal would be to promote competition by enacting a series of laws that dealt with help to accessing capital loans for approved advancement projects within sectors that would allow startups to work with large corporations and also against them for greater profit margins.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Class Placements</h2>
                <p>The next step would be necessary in order to go through with financial alleviation  of the entire infrastructure of class placement in the United States. This is the assessment of the financial and economic security of the middle class to handle the majority of the weight of the economy. Making a useful solution relies on the fact that the middle class can take the majority of the workload in running an economic infrastructure without rampant consumer fear wearing off the persistence to work through tough economic crises. An assessment of financial security, job security, debt repayment, credit, and income growth would be helpful in assessing the overall ability of the middle class to handle wealth management and recursion. The assessment wouldn’t just take into account the basic financial and job characteristics of the middle class such as the ones mentioned before, but an emphasis would be placed on the consumer habits of the middle class as well when placed in an increased income bracket. For example, taking into account the increase in luxury spending vs. an increase in investment when there was entrance into new wealth brackets. Also, looking at the ability of increased wages across small business owners as well as business spending when placed in an increased tax bracket could be helpful in determining the ability of small businesses and their owners  to provide a better lifestyle to the workers and for themselves in the future.</p>
                <p>Following a successful assessment of the middle class ability to take on the majority of the economy, there would be a policy for implementation of funding for access to capital for small businesses in order to somewhat change the competitive landscape. The way in which this funding would be made available would be through two major initiatives. The first is the end of corporate tax breaks in exchange for investment in the economy that multi billion dollar corporations currently have in the U.S.. The end of these tax breaks would mean that multi-billion dollar corporations would be slowed down in their attempt to expand heavily and the excess wealth would create a fund by which to provide small businesses with capital loans without worry of reallocation of funds which are already implemented into other economic initiatives. Also, the fund would be implemented in a separate economic sector based entirely on these taxes meaning that the majority of the tax money would never go through a traditional tax accountant within the United States Tax Department. The second part of the policy would come in the form of an increase in taxes on high net worth individuals whose income is past a conceivable spending value. Specifically, those with a net worth over $10,000,000 should see a massive increase in their tax structure that takes away initiatives from the Trump administration that successfully cut down over 40% of taxes on these individuals. Furthermore, the more the person makes, the higher they go in the tax structure, even in the case of increased investment, unless they decide to put funding into the economic fund for small businesses out of pocket. The result of this action should be greater capital interest and industrial expansion within small businesses as well as promotion of competitive circumstances with ability to purchase advanced production machinery and have access to new industrial technology.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Effect of Lack of Tax Breaks</h2>
                <p>After tax breaks have been taken away and an increase in taxes have taken place with the implementation of new tax breaks, the United States would have to establish a new minimum wage. In this case, for reasons of creating greater wealth and income equality, they would want to raise the minimum wage for the United States by nearly 25%. The current minimum wage for the U.S. sits at $7.25 and has not been raised at all in the last two years. With inflation, that means the average worker who takes minimum wage at this amount would be making about 18% less than they did a decade ago when the last change to the minimum wage increase occurred on a federal level. To compare that with increased costs of living due to inflation, it is no surprise why the standard of living of most low income workers sits at a recent all time low. With the concept of an increased federal minimum wage, workers would gain access to increased goods, making luxury affordable within the U.S. for the short term. Also, greater access to wealth and closing of gaps for wages would lead to greater financial stability for those affected by a national wage increase.  The simplest and easiest solution to this problem is to introduce legislation based on incremental wage increases every six months to a year that is aimed at getting to the desired wage point around $10-$13. The number comes from an aspect of political negotiability as the two major American political parties, the Republicans and the Democrats, sit at two opposing points when it comes to increasing the national minimum wage. One, namely the Democrats, would like to see a near $15 minimum wage while the Republicans would rather that the wage stay low and stable. Generally, this would be of greater beneficial value to large corporations which are supporters of the conservatism ideals of the Republican party. The result is that the two parties would have to meet in the middle near $10 where there wouldn’t be as drastic of an effect on the resulting money supply, but it would be politically acceptable and plausible to pass. The concept of negotiability of implementation, such as that of taxes and other economic initiatives, is going to be a recurring concept in this series as it will continuously impact the policy of implementation in future parts of the series.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>What to do with the excess Government Revenue</h2>
                <p>Okay so now we have this excess money laying around. What is to be done with it? There are so many places that this money could go in order to make an impact on wealth inequality. Who is going to make the decision as to which of these initiatives the excess tax fund should be devoted to. Well this is where the proposition of the first committee in the plan comes into play. This committee, dubbed the “Excess Tax Fund Allocations Committee” or the ETFAC for short, would be in charge of the wealth allocation within the actual middle class itself. Not all the money would go directly into small businesses as arguments for more success of individuals to pull money into a class would come down to a number of factors. These come down to the development of the class and their ability to have their needs met prior to the need to devote wealth to causes that the upper class does not have to deal with due to luxury lifestyles. Some common but important examples within the middle class would be the educational and job opportunities creation, financial education and personal financial literacy, public and private infrastructure to important services, economic stability and retirement funds, entrepreneurial growth and small business growth rate in general, and the small business administration initiatives which are already in place. There is no exact right or wrong answer as to which of these would have the greatest effect on the economic environment in the future because it truly depends on the work force to which it is applied. A more in depth description of each one will be provided in the specific explanations that come in later parts. For now, the important things that this committee will focus on is the wealth allocation, and their decisions will impact much of the solutions to come in the future of the solution. The decision of the importance of one initiative over the other will prove detrimental to progress in evening the wealth concentration of the country to a middle stance.</p>
                <p>After these couple initial processes have caused an onslaught of panic across the United States based on increased worry about future landscape of the economy, there would likely be a gap to be filled by an administration to take all excess funds created from the tax initiatives proposed above and allocate them to the right businesses in order to meet the goals of economic development under the specific political party in power. This second administration which for now, I have dubbed the “Excess Tax Small Business Eligibility Department” or the ETSBED, for short, would be created to fill the gap. This specific administration is more of a seasonal committee that would be charged with taking special case applications from medium sized businesses in order to assess their ability to become a profitable and stable sized business that can manage a year to year wage increase for employees and look towards longevity of retention for these employees as well as create new jobs in the process of completing that already long task list. They will meet once a year, following tax season, to make decisions on which businesses could be eligible to receive funds from the excess tax funds that would be created following the new tax initiatives. There are going to be a variety of factors that have to be taken into account by the committee whether to accept or decline applications that are submitted. First of all, looking at the industry or sector of the business is important to promote competition and look at the likelihood of growth. There is also financial liability of the business owner or owners who are taking out the extra fund loan. These loans have special characteristics that will be better suited for business owners who can take on financial strain placed by a large loan or debt which means they must meet a certain credit score and financial history in order to be considered. There will be criminal background checks with a time limit of a decade prior conviction in order to qualify to apply. Lastly, after considering financials, background will also be taken into account as there should be diversity in economic development so targeting multiple age groups of owners, genders, races, and ethnic backgrounds will be a key goal of the committee. </p>
                <p>I know committees may not be the most interesting topic of discussion, but we have one more and possibly the most important one to make sure the Excess Tax Fund is being put to good use (don’t worry this is the beginning of a long onslaught of committees, departments, and administrations to come throughout the series). This next committee wouldn’t really be a committee at all but a department of the Small Business Administration and an extension of the selection committee stated above for applicants to large risky loans for expansion. The goal of this committee would be to focus on the business financials of the small business applying for the loan. A team of analysts with specialization in geographical business settings would work with a team of financial consultants and economists to come up with the details of the prime financials of a business in an industry located in a certain region of the United States, effectively removing geographical bias so that regions with higher prices and general higher income are not mistaken for better small business locations. There will be more about some of the specific financials to different regions of the United States in the specific explanation of phase 1 of implementation in another article. This department will also be in charge of the forgiveness of the loans and keeping track of the accounting of the businesses progress to pay back the loan in order to gauge the relative success of their decision and improve year to year to create better flow of funds into guaranteed success bases. Though there will be plenty of unique characteristics to these loans and grants from the Excess Tax Fund, some of the defining characteristics of the general loans are as follows. The business, if approved, will be given a 7 year loan to their operations which is paid in full on the spot. After 2-3 years, a financial assessment board will look at company financials as well as the amounts paid back (whether they are ahead, behind, or on track with their payments), resulting in a decision to either forgive 25% of the loan or do nothing and continue the payments as scheduled. There would also be the opportunity to decrease the interest rate on the loans to near nothing or nothing at all if the SBA sees a benefit in the businesses financials to increased cash on hand. This is all subjective for the department which is why it is important to establish those guidelines which were stated above. The result should be a trial and error type use of the fund that would continue to improve to near perfection in spotting prime candidates in a variety of industries to take on competition and become more profitable than they currently are.</p>
                <p>Now that we have some structure to the wealth concentration ideas through some organizational processing, we have to talk about a downside to giving all this money to small businesses that would usually be used to continue to develop large corporations. The one which is of specific concern is technological and idealistic advancement. This is simply the idea that these large corporations and businesses, rather than paying taxes, contribute to society by furthering advancement through in depth research of new technology, new methods of creation, and building infrastructure. These corporations also use the money to promote self growth through these methods which opens up to an ethical question for most people. Do they continue to let the large businesses keep their tax money in order to foster development in society or do they treat them equal to small businesses and take the risk of prolonged development with less real use of the money that they have at hand? It truly is a tough question to answer and one that the government has attempted to answer many times to no success as it truly is a question that is completely opinionated with no side being completely wrong or right in its beliefs. Though, I do think there may be a way to make it work by splitting it into categories of needs. In this way it may become slightly discriminatory to certain industries, but it would offer a solution that could be continued to change in the long term to meet with society’s needs at the time. But what do I characterize by needs? Needs is referring to overarching problems that undermine the ability for a large part of society to function to its full extent. For example, financial stability is one of the biggest needs that society must fulfill which means that focusing on growth within this sector to include small business advances in investment, loans, and other financial needs is necessary in order to provide true competition and growth in an area where there is a guaranteed customer usage of business. This is just one of many examples (more of which will be discussed in the specific explanation) that characterize a possibility for small businesses to foster real advancement, usually through better customer-client interactions. These advancement based businesses will be part of the organization of Excess Tax Small Business Eligibility Department or the ETSBED, which was mentioned earlier, who will organize a special category for these businesses where risk may be greater due to the reward of new research being of a higher value than normal business practices. The result being, that in some cases, there may be a need to continue to fund large corporations research practices in order to maintain societal advancement. In other cases, with correct selection based on industry and needs, funding small business advancement instead would promote competition and allow for a regular advancement pace within the industry itself.</p>
                <p>Well, is this really enough, to combat the effects of large businesses, especially when it comes down to better pricing of products than most small businesses could afford which makes the competition seem a lot less tight for larger corporations. The reason for this is what we call type 1 actions in economics which will be discussed at a later time. For now, the important thing to know about type 1 is that it causes people to choose better pricing over any other of the important factors when it comes to choosing a product, so how do we level the playing field? Well this really begins to get into another gray area due to the number of ways that you could deal with this problem. There is either strengthening the national economy or the global economy through tariffs or the solution that I propose which is promoting international development. How is it possible that small businesses can have access to international products or any international work in general? Well, it comes down to business connections. What I think would work well for small businesses is creating a database of manufacturers and wholesalers across international borders with U.S. trade partners. The database would work with the trade department and the committee department would actually be part of the Small Business Administration to help find international partners for businesses if they reach a certain valued point. This will help businesses reach greater market capacities and increase their supply flow to meet a surplus of demand as they begin to grow and put increased strain on competition. The result being that small businesses are able to use foreign markets to increase their business here in the United States such as which large manufacturers are already able to do. The database would pair them with their needs and our trade partners would flourish as well with exports if need be.</p>

                <h2>Author's Note</h2>
                <p>This is part 1 of the Broad Solution to solving wealth inequality. Part 2 will be coming soon! It is going to be focusing on actual intiatives by individuals, the government, and businesses that will have to take place to make the entirety of the solution work. At the same time, it will discuss how to make sure that the entire U.S. economy does not just collapse at any given moment. I’m looking forward to releasing it soon. This series has been great so far. There is still a lot to come, and I for one am excited!</p>
